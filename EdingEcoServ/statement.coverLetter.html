Dear Dr. Casey Ryan and Dr. Janet Fisher


My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Associate: Ecosystem Services and Human Wellbeing”, as part of the Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES) programme. I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where explored the possible impacts of future environmental change on ecosystem resilience and services in tropical and sub-tropical woodland and savanna in Australia - vegetation types similar to the woodlands of Mozambique. These ecosystem types are likely to be very sensitive to environmental changes, and many of the key conclusions of my thesis have important implication for the development of mitigation and adaptation policies in Australia. However, the impacts of future change are likely to be much worse for the people of Mozambique, and indeed most of the people in poorer regions of the world, than for Australia. These impacts will potentially be compounded further from anthropogenic landscape changes often associated with economic development.


I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist in developing and implementing effective land use policy that will help some of the world's most vulnerable people adapt to future social-ecological changes. I believe that the ACES research programme at Edinburgh is the ideal environment for this – the cross-disciplinary set-up will bring together the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the ecological complexity and dynamic links between land use, ecosystem services and the wellbeing of Mozambique's rural poor. And the programmes partnership with scientists in Mozambique will draw on local expertise and help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.


Below, I have expanded on the brief "supporting statement" part of the application, outlining how my research experience makes me an ideal candidate for the role. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.

<h2> Academic attainment </h2>
My research to date has focussed on constraining vegetation models to improve our understanding of the linkages between ecosystem dynamics, climate, land properties and use  in Australian tropical and subtropical woodland and savanna. My PhD thesis in Climate Change Ecology focussed on the development of one of these model, LPX, which I used to assess the impacts of future environmental change on climate, vegetation, fire and hydrology interactions. This included counterintuitive but important results important for developing mitigation and adaptation policy, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying agricultural regions; and that the main driver for changes in fire and its impacts will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation and land cover rather than weather and climate. My thesis therefore tied together all major components of research that will be performed by the role by exploring the impact of ecosystem and land use change on society. The importance on my thesis was reflected in my examiner's comments, who consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.




<h2> Programming and Data analysis </h2>
My work on constraining vegetation models involved the processing and statistical analysis of a range of ecological, climate and land use data, including remote sensed and ground-observed GIS data products and site-based observations. For example, development of the LPX model involved processing raw satellite and ground observed lighting data to design its fire ignitions scheme; soils maps and meta-data analysis of root profiles to parameterize plant rooting depth; weather-station based atmospheric drying potential and site based litter production/decomposition flux inventories to develop a litter drying and decomposition scheme; comparison of agricultural maps against fire observations to develop a statistical algorithm describing anthropogenic fire suppression; and construction of two site-based plant trait databases describing woody plant adaptations to resist and recovery from disturbances (i.e bark thickness, resprouting and re-seeding stratagies). The description of model development and its statistical analysis has been published in a number of peer-reviewed papers including <citet>Prentice2011;Kelley2014a</citet> and <citet>Kelley2014b<citet>. This demonstrates my invalable expertise in analysis of a variety of relevant ecological and land use data, and applying results to construct complex ecological models that can be used to assess impacts of environmental change.


The trait database exploring plant disturbance recovery provides an example of my use of statistical knowledge and data management to tease apart complex relationships between local environmental conditions and vegetation trait expression. Here, I determined climatic and fire regime controls on the prevalence of plant resprouting ability (RS). I selected possible control variables after testing for redundancy using principal component analysis and quantified the degree of control of each component using a generalised linear model. This analysis demonstrated the importance RS as a recovery trait to specific fire regimes which was used to guide the incorporation of post-fire resprouting into LPX. It also showed a high abundance of specific RS types associated with areas of highly variable rainfall, which has spawned research into RS as a recovery adaptation to drought (see e.g. <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>).


Performing these data analyses and statistical comparisons has allowed me to become fluent in most common statistical programming languages and GIS software appropriate for the role, including R, Python, Matlab, and IDL, ArcGIS, ENVI and QGIS. I have even developed some of my statistical R code into freely available software packages (http://douglask3.github.io/tools, see pg 7 of cv for more information). One of these  packages (model benchmark metrics: http://douglask3.github.io/vegetation-model-benchmarking.html) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. In one, I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions, and allowed me to gain experience organising a multi-disciplinary, international collaborative project. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups, demonstrating my ability to deliver key research objectives and share research projects amongst the research community.


I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves.




<h2> Communication </h2>
I completed my PhD just over a year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.


During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I won “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting.




<h2> Research group involvement and teamwork </h2>
I acted as chair for my PhDs research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.


Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars and running modelling workshops on programming for beginners.


What these examples show is that I am a team-orientated person, who enjoys using my skills and knowledge for the benefit of the research group as a whole, which would make me a great addition to your team!





Thank you for taking the time to review my application. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above.


I look forward to hearing from you.
