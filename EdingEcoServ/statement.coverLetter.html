Dear 	Emma Blacklock

I am preparing applications for the "Reasearch Fellow" positions linked with the SCALEFORES project. First off, may I offer my congratulations for obtaining the ERC starting grant for such an exciting and fascinating project. Information on ecosystem function and service value will be vital for mitigation and adaptation to future environmental change. Your recent work on quantifying the uncertainty in many of the techniques and analytical decisions used to map services shows how far we still have to go before we can target specific 'hotspots' for protection, particularly with the complication of added ecosystem vulnerability associated with future environmental change. This is why the SCALEFORES project is so timely and important. I have a few questions about the project's research aims, and a couple about timing of the appointment:

<li> Is "win-win" in the project description equivalent to areas of hotspot overlap (i.e. Eigenbrod et al. 2010: Journal of Applied Ecology) </li>
<li> Will the project aim to find general rules of scale-dependancy applicable to any spatially-distributed ecological service, or will the relationships between variables be targetted to specific services? Either way, which services will the project be testing/exploring?  </li>
<!--<li> The "Research Fellow in Spatial Modellings" will aim to explore components of scale-dependancy. What exactly are these components? Are they the </li> -->
<li> I notice the "Research Fellow in Applied Biogeography" will be testing scale-dependancy of relationships in data-rich Europe. Is Europe, therefore,  the testing ground for the project before application to data-poor regions of the world? Are there any particular data-poor regions in mind?
<li> Obviously the project will be exploring scale-dependency using present day observations. But are there any plans to apply any relationships found to potential changes in services under future environmental change? </li>

<li> I notice the positions starts from the 1st of July. Is this fixed or, if I was successful in my application, could the start date be brought forward? There wouldn't be any problem if not - and I see you are actually moving departments yourself so I'm guessing the timetable is pretty fixed. But it will just help me plan the next couple of months a bit. Do you know when are you planning to short-list/interview etc?</li>


I hope that's not too many questions!

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
