Dear 	Emma Blacklock

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Associate: Ecosystem Services and Human Wellbeing”, as part of the  Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES) programme. I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where explored the possible impacts of future enviormental change on ecosystem resiliance and specific services.

I would reslish to opptunity to extend my skills and expleriance I gained from my time ... to .. directly influance development.

ACES, to help in the design of these methods that will help bridge an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time studying ecosystem ?? in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist the development ...., as well as directly influencing policy decisions that will help some of the world most vulnerable people adapt to climate change. I believe that the REACH research programme at Oxford is the ideal environment for this – the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the complex nature of the impact of climate variability on water security, whilst the groups' social science component, and the programmes partnership with universities and institutes in Africa, will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

In my application I outline how my experience in the vegetetation modelling and large-scale data analysis makes me an ideal candidate for this role, with reference to the job description and selection criteria. Further details are provided in the attached CV and publication record.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
