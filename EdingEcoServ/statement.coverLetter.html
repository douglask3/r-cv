Dear Casey Ryan and Janet Fisher

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Associate: Ecosystem Services and Human Wellbeing”, as part of the  Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES) programme. I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where explored the possible impacts of future enviormental change on ecosystem resiliance and services in tropical and sub-tropical woodland and savanna in Australia - vegetation types siumilar to the woodlands of Mozambique. These ecosystem types are likley to be very sensative to enviromental changes, and many of the key conclusions of my thesis have important implication for the development of mitigation and adaptation policies in Australia. However, the impacts of change for society in Mozambique, and indeed most of the poorer regions of the world, are likely to be much worse than for Australia, compromised futher from landscape changes often associated with economic development. <!--The rural poor, who make up roughly 80% of the regions population <citep>TheWorldBankGroup2016</citep>  are already severely affected by periodic droughts and floods <citep>Carter2007</citep>. The rapid economic development in some East African  countries <citep>Imf2012</citep> may, if unguided,  put additional strain on water resources, as has happened in other parts of the world where increased urbanisation has led to increased water demand from water-intensive agriculture and energy production and decreased supply because of pollution and changes in land use <citep>falkenmark1992population</citep>.-->

I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist in developing and implementing effective land use policy that will help some of the world most vulnerable people adapt to future social and ecological changes. I believe that the ACES research programme at Edingbourgh is the ideal environment for this – the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the ecological complexity and dynamic links between land use, ecosystem sercives and the wellbeing of Mozambiques rural poor. And the programmes partnership with scientists in Mozambique will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

Below, I have expanded on the brief "supporting statement" part of the applition oulining how my reserach experience makes me an ideal candidate for the role. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.




<h2> Academic attainment </h2>
<!--An established research interest in land use change, ecosystem science or development studies
A PhD (or a PhD close to completion), or equivalent, in a relevant field, or equivalent experience-->

My research to date has focussed on constraining vegetation models to improve our undersatnding of the linkages between ecosystem dynamics, climate, land propertise and use <!--to explore the affects of future environmental change on vegetation reiliance and services--> in Australian tropical and subtropical woodland and savanna - similar vegetation types as those experienced in Mozambique. My PhD thesis in Climate Change Ecology focussed on the development of one of these model, LPX-Mv1, which I used to assess the impacts of future envoiromental change on climate,vegetation,fire and hydrology interactions. This included counterintuitive but important results for developing mitigation and adpation policy, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying argicultural regions; and that the main driver for changes in fire and its impacts, will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation/land cover rather than weather and climate. My thesis therefore tied together all major components of research that will be performed by the role by exploring the impact of ecosystem and land use change on society.
The imporantce on my thesis was refelcted in my examiners comments, who consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

<!--During my MSc in Earth Systems Science ...-->

<h2> Programming and Data analysis </h2>
<!--Expertise in undertaking socio-ecological analysis
    Excellent statistical knowledge and data management ability, using appropriate programming languages-->
My work on constraining vegetetaion models involved processing and staistical analysi of a range of ecological, climate and land use data, including remote sensed and ground-observed GIS data products and site-based observations. For example, development of the LPX-Mv1 model involved processesing RAW satalite and ground observed lighting data to design its fire ignition scheme; meta-data anaysis of soil maps root profiles to parameterize plant rooting depth; weather-station based atomospheric drying potential and site based production/decompoitsion flux inventories to develope a litter drying and decompoisition scheme; comparison of agricultural maps against fire observations to develope a staistical alorgirthm describing anthropagenic fire supression; and construction of two site-based plant trait databases describing woody plant adaptations to resist and recovery from disturbances (i.e bark thickness, resprouting and re-seeding stratagies). I publiched description of model development and its statistical analysis in <citet>Prentice2011;Kelley2014a</citet> and <citet>Kelley2014b<citet>.

The two trait databases are great examples of my use of staistical knowledge to tease apart complex realistionships between local enviromental conditions and vegetation trait expression. <<>>. Despritions of the databases are co-constructed can be found in <citet>Kelley2014a; Harrisonc</citet>, and demostrate my ability in data analysis and managment projects - from collection and design of databases through to publication.


Performing these data-analyses and staistical comparisons has allowed me to become fluent in most common staistical programmining languanges and GIS software, including R, Python, Matlab, and IDL, ArcGIS and ENVI and their open source equivalents <<>>. I have even developed some of my R statistical code into freely avaiable software packages (http://douglask3.github.io/tools, see pg ?? of cv for more information). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: http://douglask3.github.io/vegetation-model-benchmarking.html) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

<h2> Work stuff </h2>
<!-- Strong problem solving skills to allow you to deliver research objectives
     Proven ability to work independently and efficiently
     Excellent organisational and communication (both written and oral) skills4
     Proven ability to collaborate with scientists in different fieldss
     Proven ability to work as a member of an international team -->

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system. This involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions, and allowed me to gain experiance organising a multi-discaplinary, international collbartive project. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. <!--I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.-->

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.


<h2> Communication </h2>
<!-- Ability to lead author publications in the peer reviewed literature -->
<!-- Excellent organisational and communication (both written and oral) skills -->
<!-- Peer reviewed publications in a relevant field  -->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I won “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting. I also acted as chair for my groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students who were new to statistical programming.


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley

I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based observations, soil and land-cover GIS maps and constructed spatial databases of species richness and plant-traits to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, fire regimes, drought and hydrology in Australia. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techniques designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation decisions that, by necessity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques in many parts of the world. By determining scale-dependancy of relationships between different ESs in data-rich regions, SCALEFORS will help develop and test accurate ways to map hotspots in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD, outlined below, to help in the design of these methods that will help bridge an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

<h2> Ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis</h2>
My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground and climate observations, and climate and vegetation model output. To do this, I have used a range of GIS and statistical software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R, Python and Matlab. More detail can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral work involved a number of research collaborations. For example, I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community.
??I was also involved in a consultancy programme performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.??

I also acted as chair for my groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students who were new to statistical programming.

Whilst at Bristol, I volunteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summarising scientific information and recording decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.
