I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based observations, soil and land-cover GIS maps and constructed spatial databases of species richness and plant-traits to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, fire regimes, drought and hydrology in Australia. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techniques designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation decisions that, by necessity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques in many parts of the world. By determining scale-dependancy of relationships between different ESs in data-rich regions, SCALEFORS will help develop and test accurate ways to map hotspots in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD, outlined below, to help in the design of these methods that will help bridge an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

<h2> Ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis</h2>
My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground and climate observations, and climate and vegetation model output. To do this, I have used a range of GIS and statistical software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R, Python and Matlab. More detail can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral work involved a number of research collaborations. For example, I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community.
<!--I was also involved in a consultancy programme performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.-->

<h2> Communication </h2>
During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I won “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting. I also acted as chair for my groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students who were new to statistical programming.

Whilst at Bristol, I volunteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summarising scientific information and recording decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my experience in vegetation modelling and spatial statistical analysis, I am well suited to the role. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Kind regards,
