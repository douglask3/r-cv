<h2> Academic attainment </h2>
<!--An established research interest in land use change, ecosystem science or development studies
A PhD (or a PhD close to completion), or equivalent, in a relevant field, or equivalent experience-->

My research to date has focussed on constraining vegetation models to improve our undersatnding of the linkages between ecosystem dynamics, climate, land propertise and use <!--to explore the affects of future environmental change on vegetation reiliance and services--> in Australian tropical and subtropical woodland and savanna - similar vegetation types as those experienced in Mozambique. My PhD thesis in Climate Change Ecology focussed on the development of one of these model, LPX-Mv1,which I used to demonstrated the importance of incorporating climate-vegetation-fire interactions into assessments of the impacts of future envoiromental change. This included counterintuitive but important results for developental studies, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying areas; and that the main driver for changes in fire and its impacts, will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation cover rather than weather and climate. My thesis therefore tied together all major components of research that will be performed by the role - ??the impact of?? ecosystem and land use changes on the potential ??future development??.
My examiners consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

<h2> Programming and Data analysis </h2>
<!--Expertise in undertaking socio-ecological analysis
    Excellent statistical knowledge and data management ability, using appropriate programming languages-->




For this,
    <<linking together land use, emergent ecosystem traits from modelled plant>>
To devlope and evaluate vegetation models, I have utilised a variatety of spatial GIS observational  remote-sensed and ground-based observations, soil and land-cover GIS maps and constructed site=based databases of species richness and plant-traits based on field observations, species invintories and extracted GIS information.



involved processing a range of ecological and land use data, including remote sensed and ground-observed GIS data products and site-based observations. To do this, I have used a range of GIS and statistical software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R, Python and Matlab. More detail can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.



To contrain and develope these models, I used satellite and ground-based observations of land surface and ecosystem properties

to develop and evaluate complex numerical vegetation models <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; Kelley; Hantson</citep>. I have driven some of these models with historical/reanalysis climate data to assess how teleconnections between ENSO and climate affect fire <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011</citep>.
I utilised observational and experimantal data of land use cover, plant physiology and ecosystem processess to develop and constrain a complex dynamic vegetation model. I used this model to explore potential future changes in resilience of ecosystems and their associate services such as carbon stocks, fire control and hydrological impacts in Australia.



I have developed some of my R-code into software packages now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

<h2> Work stuff </h2>
<!-- Strong problem solving skills to allow you to deliver research objectives
     Proven ability to work independently and efficiently
     Excellent organisational and communication (both written and oral) skills4
     Proven ability to collaborate with scientists in different fieldss
     Proven ability to work as a member of an international team -->

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system. This involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions, and allowed me to gain experiance organising a multi-discaplinary, international collbartive project. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. <!--I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.-->

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.


<h2> Communication </h2>
<!-- Ability to lead author publications in the peer reviewed literature -->
<!-- Excellent organisational and communication (both written and oral) skills -->
<!-- Peer reviewed publications in a relevant field  -->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I won “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting. I also acted as chair for my groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students who were new to statistical programming.




<!--
I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based observations, soil and land-cover GIS maps and constructed spatial databases of species richness and plant-traits to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, fire regimes, drought and hydrology in Australia. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techniques designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation decisions that, by necessity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques in many parts of the world. By determining scale-dependancy of relationships between different ESs in data-rich regions, SCALEFORS will help develop and test accurate ways to map hotspots in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD, outlined below, to help in the design of these methods that will help bridge an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

<h2> Ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis</h2>
My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground and climate observations, and climate and vegetation model output. To do this, I have used a range of GIS and statistical software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R, Python and Matlab. More detail can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral work involved a number of research collaborations. For example, I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community.
??I was also involved in a consultancy programme performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.??

Whilst at Bristol, I volunteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summarising scientific information and recording decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.
