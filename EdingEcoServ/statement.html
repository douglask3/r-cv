I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I developed a complex vegetation process model to explore potential future changes in ecosystem resilience and services in tropical and subtropcal woodland in Austrlia - simular to Mozambiques woodland - focussing on vegetation modulated fire-regimes and water availablity, and plant drought mortality. The key conclusions have major implications for development of adaption and mitgation stratagies to future enviromental change. My thesis therefore combines the major components of the research to be performed by this role, exploring the impact of ecosystem and land use changes and providing information to help guide policy. The model I developed was constrained using staistical anaylsis of remote-sensed and ground-based GIS observations, and of vegetation trait databases I constructed, which demonstrates my skills in data managment, statistical anaylsis, and use of relavent programming languages - some of which I have developed software packages for.

The imporantce on my thesis was refelcted in my examiners comments, who consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed. Despite only completing my PhD just over a year ago, I have optained 7 publications - 2 of which I first uathored - in high impact journals. I have also won awards for my presentation skills.

I have also been involved in an inter-national consulatancy programme and number of multi-discaplinary, international academic collabrations. I lead one where we constructed a staistical benchmarking system for vegetation models, which has resulted in a publication, a freely avaiable R-software package I created independantly, and has been adopted by the vegetation modelling community via a new model intercomparison project. This demnstrates my abaility to manage international collabrations and deliver key research objectives.

I would relish the opportunity to use the experience in ecological modelling and data analysis to contribute to a research team that can assist in developing and implementing effective land use policy that will help some of the world most vulnerable people adapt to future social and ecological changes. I have attached a cover letter and cv providing more information of my research experiance.


I believe that the ACES research programme at Edingbourgh is the ideal environment for this – the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the ecological complexity and dynamic links between land use, ecosystem sercives and the wellbeing of Mozambiques rural poor. And the programmes partnership with scientists in Mozambique will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

Below, I have expanded on the brief "supporting statement" part of the applition oulining how my reserach experience makes me an ideal candidate for the role. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.
