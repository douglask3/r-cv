Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “xxxx” as part of the SCALEFORES project.
-->

I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based GIS observations to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, fire regimes, drought and hydrology. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techniques designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation decisions that, by necessity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques, particularly in parts of the world most vulnerable to future environmental change. By utilising scale-dependancy of relationships between different ESs, SCALEFORS will help develop accurate ways to map these hotspots even in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD, which I have outlined below, to contribute to a research project that will help bridge such an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

<h2> Ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis</h2>
My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground observation, climate observations and climate model output. To do this, I have used a range of statistical and GIS software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R and R statistical packages, Python and Matlab. More detail on this can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral work involved a number of research collaborations. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups
<!--I was also involved in a consultancy programme performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.-->

<h2> Communication </h2>
During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting. I also acted as chair for my research groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming.

Whilst at Bristol, I volunteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summarising scientific information and recording decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my experience in vegetation modelling and spatial statistical analysis, I am well suited to the role. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
