Whilst working on the LPX model, I developed a Unix-shell to aid parallel processing when performing runs with multiple climate realisations (such as at 36 CMIP5 future runs conducted in <cite>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</cite>). I coded a fire-risk model <citep>Harrisonc</citep> which can be run on multiple cores in R, and I have experience working with a simple vegetation model that can parallelized on a grid-cell level in C (<a href = "https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY"> https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY </a>).
