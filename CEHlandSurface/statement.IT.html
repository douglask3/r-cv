<h3> Modelling </h3>
I have been the lead developer on LPX - a high-complexity coupled Dynamic Vegetation Model - since 2010. LPX combines Fortran and C++ components for fast (relative to its complexity) computational times. I have recently added a shell and R interface to facilitate parallelization, and to allow outputs to be easily analysed and plotted. See <a href="http://douglask3.gitgub.io/LPX.html">douglask3.github.io/LPX</a> for more information. I have recently been working with the GDAY model, which has recently been re-coded in C, and has a Python interface for output collation and analysis.

I have attended training courses on code structure and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems on an HPC platform. I have applied the programming principles these courses introduced to a number of my projects (e.g. see http://douglask3.github.io/firemip for my latest project)

<h3> Statistical Programming </h3>
Most of my research involve statistical analysis of large datasets and model outputs. Collaboration on many of my projects means I am fluent in most widely used statistical programming languages. Most of my statistical work is in either R, Python or Matlab, but I have also performed graphical and statistical analysis using Fortran and C amongst others.

<h3> Web Design </h3>
In my spare time, I have developed dynamic websites using open source content management systems (such as Concrete5 and Wordpress). Also, my personal site is on a static host but is maintained using a Python based dynamic-site emulator. Developing and maintaining these sites has allowed me to become familiar with many web design software packages and fluent in HTML/CSS, PHP and Markdown. I have also linked Markdown and HTML with R and Python when sharing and presenting results from model development and analysis.

See <a href = "http://www.eppingdac.com.au/">eppingdac.com.au</a>, an example of a website I have developed using Concrete5 content management system and <a href = "http://douglask3.gothub.io">douglask3.github.io </a>, an example of a website produced using a simple dynamic-site emulator.<NewPage>

<h3> Publishing </h3>
As well as publishing papers, I have also written manuals, reports and newsletters using a variety of languages and software products, including (aside from standard office/open office):
   <li> Latex - this includes my thesis, available at <a href="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf"> http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf </a> </li>
   <li> Scribus - my running club newsletter, available at <a href="http://www.eppingdac.com.au/news-and-views/newsletter/"> eppingdac.com.au/news-and-views/newsletter </a> </li>
   <li> Photoshop/Illustrator and GIMP (the open source equivalent). See <a href = "http://flickr.com/doug_from_the_uk"> flickr.com/doug_from_the_uk </a> for examples of graphical art and photo "touch ups"/manipulation. </li>

<h3> Software Tool Development </h3>
I have developed several software package tools related to my research, and to help track project workflows. One of these has since been adopted by a new Model Intercomparison Project: fireMIP. See examples at <a href="http://douglask3.github.io/pages/tools.html" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/pages/tools </a>.
