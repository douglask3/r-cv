<h2> Science </h2>
PhD in a relevant discipline plus a degree in climate, physical or environmental sciences with good relevant experience of computer modelling

Ideally you will also have appropriate scientific understanding of land surface processes (including hydrology, plant physiology and biogeochemistry)
Existing knowledge of environmental and land surface science would be an advantage

<h2> Computing </h2>

Analyse and evaluate the outputs of the model, with particular emphasis on understanding the land component
scientific understanding of the behaviour of the land surface and its interaction with climate
Model evaluation and analysis

Earth System on High Performance Computers
high level of skill working and programming in a Linux/Unix environment
use of computer models and analysis of large volumes of data

experience of High Performance Computers is desirable
high level computer language is essential but training can be given where necessary to tailor that to the languages (principally FORTRAN and Python) required for the post



<h2> Communication </h2>
Communicate results to national and international teams of scientists
paper writing and presentation of results at international scientific meetings

<h2> Collabortation and work skills </h2>
Work with partners including the Met Office, the National Oceanography Centre and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science
good team-working skills as well as an ability to work independently and take initiative
build effective internal and external collaborations

Add new developments to the model and resolve any problems with the model code

The successful candidate will be expected to travel to frequent project meetings in Exeter, while occasional international travel may also be required
