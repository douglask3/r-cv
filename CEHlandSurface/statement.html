<h2> Relevant skills, knowledge and experience </h2>
<i><b>Please indicate why you are applying for this post and outline how your knowledge, skills and experience meet the competencies required for this role (detailed in the job posting). You should draw on your experiences from your current or previous roles or from other activities you have undertaken. </b></i>

<h2> Motivation & Sceince</h2>
<!--
* PhD in a relevant discipline plus a degree in climate, physical or environmental sciences with good relevant experience of computer modelling
* Ideally you will also have appropriate scientific understanding of land surface processes (including hydrology, plant physiology and biogeochemistry)
*  Existing knowledge of environmental and land surface science would be an advantage
* Scientific understanding of the behaviour of the land surface and its interaction with climate
-->
I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based  observations to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). I used LPX .... However, .... ??motivation??


<h2> Computing </h2>
<!--
* Analyse and evaluate the outputs of the model, with particular emphasis on understanding the land component
* Model evaluation and analysis
* Earth System Models
* use of computer models and analysis of large volumes of data
* Add new developments to the model and resolve any problems with the model code
-->

See my answer to "Experience in using Information Technology" above for more information.

As part of my thesis, I developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of multiple aspects of simulated vegetation, hydrology, disturbance regimes and ecosystem fluxes in vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. This system applies statistical metrics (including normalised mean error, taxi-cab, and metrics I designed myself) to quantify "distances" between simulations and remote-sensed observations. These metrics are normalised in such a way as to allow comparison between model processes. I also designed two 'null' benchmark models for aiding interpretation of metric scores. Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness, formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of model development on performance.

The system and associated R-package has been adopted by other modelling groups, and is currently being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>. In doing so, they are also using my benchmarking system to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.


<h2> Communication Skills</h2>
<!--
* Communicate results to national and international teams of scientists
* paper writing and presentation of results at international scientific meetings -->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field (i.e Environmental Research Letters, Biogeosciences, New Phytologist). Please see my attached publication list for more information.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see CV for a full list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website (<a href = "http://www.eppingdac.com.au" target = "_blank">www.eppingdac.com.au</a>), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.


<h2>Collaborations</h2>
<!--
* Work with partners including the Met Office, the National Oceanography Centre and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science
* build effective internal and external collaborations
* The successful candidate will be expected to travel to frequent project meetings in Exeter, while occasional international travel may also be required

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.


<h2> Department and Research Group Involvement </h2>
<!--
* good team-working skills as well as an ability to work independently and take initiative
* build effective internal and external collaborations
-->
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners.
