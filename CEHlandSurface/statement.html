<h2> Land Surface modelling and data handelling </h2>
For my PhD, I developed an explicit iterative approach to develope the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>, in which benchmarking against observations was used to identify areas for new data-driven model development and then subsequently used to evaluate whether the implementation of these new developments produces an overall improvement in model performance. This approach contrasts with the general tendency within the vegetation-fire modelling community to focus evaluation on new components, for example, the evaluation of fire treatments within DGVMs using only observations of burnt area and/or fire carbon fluxes. One reason for this partial approach to evaluation was the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system <cite>Kelley2013</cite>). I therefore developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows quantitative evaluation of multiple aspects of simulated land surface processes to identify specific model weaknesses and differences between model versions, allowing assessment of the overall impact of new parameterizations. This involved processing a range of large-scale data products including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground observation including carbon flux site information <citep>Kelley2013</citep>; and constructing of two site-based plant-trait databases <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</citep>. I have developed this system into a freely avaiable statistical software package <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. The system is now starting to be adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness and formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis. Model development focussed on improved simulation of fire and fire-vegetation interactions <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> including: a new lightning ignition algorithm; plant functional (PFT) and tissue type (i.e. heartwood, stem, branch, leag/grass) dependant litter decomposisition and drying schemes; paramterization of root profiles; finding and fixing coding "bugs" associated with grassland PFT competition; and incorporation of evolutionary driven adaptive bark thickness (for protection against fire) and post-disturbance resprouting traits (for recovery from fire) <citep>Kelley2014a;Harrison</citep>.

I concluded my thesis by using the improved version of LPX to perform experiments to explore climate and CO2 fertlization modulated changes in vegetation dynamics by driving the model with mutliple historical and reanalysis climate datasets <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>. Recent work on simulating future land-surface processes  provided the best example of managing large and complex datasets. Here, I initially drove the LPX-DGVM with detrended historic climate data, pre-industrial land use and atmospheric CO2 concentrations in order to spin-up the model. I then used historic climate, land use and atmospheric CO2 to drive the model up to the modern day. This then transitioned into 36 different climate realisations, based on 9 CMIP5 models from two different RCPs, and four atmospheric CO2 pathways. Each step involved processing and organising several GBs worth of data, and historic simulations involved model evaluation against remote sensed and ground-based observations in order to justify model use. This one project, which conluded my thesis, was all initially published in <citet>Kelley2014b</citet>, but has since spawned other papers (e.g. <cite>Harrisonc; Ukkola</cite>). My thesis was also well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

I also have experiance in using and developing other vegetation, climate and Earth System models. I have recently been working with the GDAY simple vegetation model, developing a way to incoporate and evaluate a number of different conceptual carbon and nitrogen allocation models <citep>Kelley</citep>. I have also helped in the development of a new grassland pheneology model <citep>Whitley</citep>. In the dissertation for my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I incorporated a fire model into CCDAS -  a data assimilation system used to constrain physically based parameters for use in an Earth System Model framework -  using land-surface satellite observations <citep>Kelley2008; kaminski2013bethy</citep>. During my masters, I was also able to gain experience working with ocean component of the GENIE Earth System Model and MITgcm General Circulation Model.

<h2> Communication Skills</h2>
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. Please see my attached publication list for more information.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see attached publication list). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website (<a href = "http://www.eppingdac.com.au" target = "_blank">www.eppingdac.com.au</a>), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.


<h2>Collaborations</h2>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.


<h2> Research group involvment and Teamworking </h2>
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners.
