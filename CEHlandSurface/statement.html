I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observations to develop and constrain the couple Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM)-fire model - LPX. I used LPX to explore climate influances on and potential future changes to vegetation modulated fire regimes <citep>Harrisonc</citep>, ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, drought mortality and recovery </citep>Zeppel2015</citep> and hydrology <citep>Ukkola</citep>. I have also recently collaborate on research modelling resource allocation and pheneology strategies in a simple vegetation model. The role of "Land Surface Modeller" will allow me to combine the experiance working with these two model, <<great world famous model>> <<climate coupling>>

For my PhD, I developed an explicit iterative approach to model development in the Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX: <cite>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</cite>) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), in which benchmarking against observations is used to identify areas for new data-driven parameterizations and then subsequently used to evaluate whether the implementation of these new parameterizations produces an overall improvement in model performance. This approach contrasts with the general tendency within the vegetation-fire modelling community to focus evaluation on new components, for example, the evaluation of fire treatments within DGVMs using only observations of burnt area and/or fire carbon fluxes (see e.g. <cite>Li2012; Pfeiffer2013 </cite>). One reason for this partial approach to evaluation was the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system <cite>Luo2012</cite>). I therefore developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows quantitative evaluation of multiple aspects of simulated processes to identify specific model weaknesses and differences between model versions, allowing assessment of the overall impact of new parameterizations. This involved processing a range of large-scale data products, such as raw and processed satellite data (see e.g. <cite>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; Kelley2014b</cite>); vector ground observation (<cite>Kelley2013; Kelley2014a</cite>); and the constructing of two plant-trait databases <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</citep>. I have developed this system into a freely avaiable statistical software package <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. The system is now starting to be adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness, formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of model development on performance. Model development focussed on improved simulation of fire and fire-vegetation interactions <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, and was driven by extensive data analysis. New developments included: a new lightning ignition algorithm; plant functional (PFT) and tissue type (i.e. heartwood, stem, branch, leag/grass) dependant litter decomposisition and drying schemes; paramterization of root profiles; and incorporation of eveleutionary driven adaptive bark thickness (for protection against fire) and post-disturbance resprouting traits (for recovery from fire) <citep>Kelley2014a;Harrison</citep>.


I have used this improved version of LPX to perform historic and future experiment to explore climate and CO2 fertlization modulated changes in vegetation dynamics by driving the model with mutliple historical and  reanalysis climate data <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>. Recent work on simulating future land-surface processes  provided the best example of managing large and complex datasets. Here, I initially drove the LPX-DGVM  with detrended historic climate data, pre-industrial land use and atmospheric compositions in order to spin-up the model. I then used historic climate, land use and atmospheric composition to drive the model up to the modern day. This then transitioned into 36 different climate realisations, based on 9 CMIP5 models from two different RCPs, and four atmospheric CO2 pathways. Each step involved processing and organising several GBs worth of data, and historic simulations involved model evaluation against remote sensed and ground-based observations in order to justify model use. This one project was all initially published in <citet>Kelley2014b</citet>, but has since spawned other papers (e.g. <cite>Harrisonc; Ukkola</cite>).


<!--As part of my thesis, I developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of multiple aspects of simulated vegetation, hydrology, disturbance regimes and ecosystem fluxes in vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. This system applies statistical metrics (including normalised mean error, taxi-cab, and metrics I designed myself) to quantify "distances" between simulations and remote-sensed observations. These metrics are normalised in such a way as to allow comparison between model processes. I also designed two 'null' benchmark models for aiding interpretation of metric scores. Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness, formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of model development on performance.

The system and associated R-package has been adopted by other modelling groups, and is currently being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>. In doing so, they are also using my benchmarking system to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.-->

<h2> Communication Skills</h2>
<!--
* Communicate results to national and international teams of scientists
* paper writing and presentation of results at international scientific meetings -->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. Please see my attached publication list for more information.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see attached publication list). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website (<a href = "http://www.eppingdac.com.au" target = "_blank">www.eppingdac.com.au</a>), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.


<h2>Collaborations</h2>
<!--
* Work with partners including the Met Office, the National Oceanography Centre and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science
* build effective internal and external collaborations
* The successful candidate will be expected to travel to frequent project meetings in Exeter, while occasional international travel may also be required
-->

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.


<h2> Department and Research Group Involvement </h2>
<!--
* good team-working skills as well as an ability to work independently and take initiative
* build effective internal and external collaborations
-->
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners.
