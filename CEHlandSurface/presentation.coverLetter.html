Dear Dr Douglas Clark

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Land Surface Modeller”, running and analysing the JULES land surface model. I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observations to develop and constrain the Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX) coupled Dynamic Global Vegetation-Fire Model. I used LPX to explore the influences of climate and atmospheric CO2 fertilisation on historic and future vegetation modulated fire regimes, ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, drought mortality and recovery, and hydrology. I have also recently collaborated on the modelling of resource allocation and phenology strategies in a simple vegetation model.

The role of "Land Surface Modeller" will allow me to combine the experience I gained working with these two modelling systems, as well as work on one of the most comprehensive and widely used land-surface models in the community. JULES's coupling into the Met Office Unified Model will also allow me to further develop my land surface modelling skills by considering vegetative feedbacks on climate.

In my application I outline how my experience in the modelling of land surface processes and large-scale data analysis makes me an ideal candidate for this role, with reference to the job description and selection criteria. Further details are provided in the attached CV and publication record. An extended, academic-style CV can be found at <a href = "http://douglask3.github.io/docs/cvCEH.pdf"> http://douglask3.github.io/docs/cvCEH.pdf </a>.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
