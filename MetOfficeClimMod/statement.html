Dear xxx



My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Frontiers of Global Climate Modelling” as part of the PRIMAVERA and HighResMIP projects, exploring high resultion simulations of climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I utilised experimental and satellite data to develop and constrain a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestrial biosphere dynamics <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>. The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the skills outlined in the job specification, and my MSc in Earth Systems Science provides background knowledge of climate processes and climate dynamics. Below I have outlined the relevant skills I honed during my PhD and MSc, followed by my motivation for studying high resolution climate science.

<h2> Academic Attainment </h2>
<h3>An honours degree in a physical science, mathematics or other related discipline
for appointment at Scientist level A PhD or equivalent research experience in a relevant field is required </h3>

<h3>A PhD in Physical Science or Mathematics (or equivalent research experience in a relevant field)</h3>

For my PhD I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain  models of terrestrial biosphere processes <citep>Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Kelley2014a; Kelley</citep>. I have driven some of these models with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of future climate change on biosphere dynamics, including ecosystem resilience, the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire/drought disturbances and resultant carbon emissions <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Zeppel2014; Harrisonc</citep>, and hydrology </citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis (available here: <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf</a>) was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

My MSc in Earth System Science provided a broader overview of the Earth and climate system, with an emphasis on climate modelling and feedbacks. During my MSc, I was given the opportunity to write my own simple climate-box model and gained experience driving a GCM (MITgcm) and the ocean component of an Earth System Model (GENIE). The module on natural hazards also included the impact of climate varaibility of future change on incidence of fire and storms.


<h2> Worky Stuff </h2>
<h3>Evidence of a high capacity for innovative thought and problem solving </h3>
The fundemtals of any computer programming project is atomation of tasks (imagine trying to solved the state and differnential equations in any climate or Earth system model billions of times by hand!). However, this is a prinnicle often forgetten in the vegetation modelling community when conducting and analysising experiments, speiclaly with different climate relaisiations are involved. This was the case when I inheritted the LPX-DGVM. Each new experiment had to be set-up individully - changing inital state conditions, input file names and paths by hand - and then having to manipulate outputs for anayalis after the model had completed each run. This not only takes a huge amount of time, but introduces the possibility of typos and mistakes into each run. Applications of LPX always involve multiple runs (e.g, multiple climate model inputs in <cite>Ciais2011l; harrison2010impacts<cite>, multiple models, seniors and CO2 concentrations in <cite>Kelley2014b; HarrisonFutures2010</cite>, or different LPX-setups in <cite> Kelley2014a </cite>). Any historic run is benchmarked using <citet>Kelley2013</citet>, and almost all runs require outputs partricular format.

I now try and apply this principle of automation to al of my work. Any code I have devloiped that I am likley to use again I convert into easily imported libraries or software-packages, which has the added advantage of being easily shared with other people. For examples, <citet>Kelley2015</citet> has been picked up by a model intercomparrison project (fireMIP, <cite>Hanson2016</cite>). Even my CV and cover letter are generated using a code I am developing into a library for anyone to use ??githib site??.


<h3>Evidence of capability to work in a highly collaborative environment both internally and externally, with good inter-personal skills </h3>
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

<h2> Programming and Data Analysis Skills </h2>
<h3>Good scientific computing skills, ideally with experience of automation through scripting languages (such as perl and python) and of numerical analysis </h3>
The LPX model <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014a </citep>, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. Handling the data used to constrain and drive this model has provided a wealth of experience with shell-scripting for data file organisation, and statistical and GIS programming for analysis (e.g Python, R, Matlab, IDL, ArcGIS and its open source equivalents). I have published some of my statistical code independently as software packages available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/tools" target ="_blank">http://douglask3.github.io/tools</a>), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

<h3>Experience of working with scientific simulation or analysis codes, using parallel computing techniques (e.g. MPI, OpenMP) in HPC environments </h3>
Whilst working on the LPX model, I developed a unix-shell to aid parallel processing when performing run with multiple climate realisations (such as at 36 CMIP5 future runs conducted in <cite>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</cite>). I coded a fire-risk model <citep>Harrisonc</citep> for which can be run on multile cores in R, and I have experiance working with a simple vegetation model that can parallised on a grid-cell level in C (<a href = "https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY"> https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY </a>).

<h3>Experience of the execution and analysis of data from climate or weather models on HPC platforms</h3>
As well as my experiance driving vegetation and fire models using parallel computing, I have attened training courses on code structure and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems on a HPC platform. I have applied the programming princilples these coureses introduced into my code development of projects (e.g. see ??github?? for latest)

<h3>Experience of working with and managing large data sets </h3>

My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, from raw and processed satellite data (see e.g. <cite>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; Kelley2014b</cite>); vector ground observation (<cite>Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</cite>); historical climate and climate reanalysis data <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>. Recent work on simulating future land-surface processes processes provided the best example of managing large and complex datasets. Here, I drove the LPX-DGVM initally with detrened historic climate data and pre-industrial land use and atmosperic compostions (for the spin-up step), followed by historic climate, land use and atomopsheric compostion (for "ramping-up" to modern day state). This then tranisitioned into 36 different climate realisations, based on 9 CMIP5 models from two different RCPs, <<anaomolies jons thesis>> and four atmoepric CO2 pathways. Each step invivoled processing and orgainising several GBs worth of data, and historic simulations involved model evualtion againste remote sensed and ground based obsverations. This one project was all initally published in <citet>Kelley2014b</cite>, but has since sporned other papers (e.g. <cite>Harrisonc; Ukkola</cite>).



<h2> Communication Skillls </h2>
<h3> Evidence of good written and oral communication skills </h3>

I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conferences, visits, and internal departmental presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my department's annual postgraduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulations of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting <citep> kelley2013implications </citep>.

<h2> Climate Science Knowledge Research Experience </h2>
<h3> Understanding of climate projections and climate change </h3>


<h2> Motivation </h2>

Many of the predicted impacts from my research on terrestrial biosphere dynamics contain important conclusions for mitigation and adaptation policies for future climate change (eg. <cite> Kelley2014b; Ukkola; Harrisonc</cite>). However, these impact "forecasts" are still largely qualitative due to uncertainties in the predictability of climate variability, and particularly weather extremes, on a regional level (e.g. <cite>Friedlingstein2006;Shukla2008; kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</cite>).

A majot reason why extreme weather is poorly resolbved in climate models ??Ref from fire paper?? is because it is largley caused by sub-grid level processess comapred to trhe resolution climate models are traditional ran at (i.e extreme lighting and rain from conventive storms). Howevwer, recent advances in scientific understandng of unified weather and climatye prediction and computing power provide the oppertunity to explore much high scale regional future climate simualtions which could provide invaluable information to aid adaptation strategies. I would relish the opportunity to apply the experience I gained from studying climate impacts in Australia to the challenge of improving our predictive understanding of chamges in extreme weather, whioch will directly benefit adaptation policies that could help ...


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my climate research and modelling experience, and my programming and climate data analysis skills, I am well suited to the role.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and/or email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley

An open research question remains, however, regarding the ability of the current generation of climate models to provide societies with accurate and reliable predictions of regional climate change, including the statistics of extreme events and high impact weather, which are required for global and local adaptation strategies. http://heron.directrouter.co.uk/~itfnvazy/hrcm/

The Weather and Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Modelling Panel (WMP) recently concluded that “regional projections from the current generation of climate models were sufficiently uncertain to compromise the goal of providing society with reliable predictions of regional climate change. Therefore, a major recommendation by the group was that, to meet the expectations of society, it is both necessary and possible to revolutionise climate prediction.
