<h2> Motivation </h2>
An open research question remains, however, regarding the ability of the current generation of climate models to provide societies with accurate and reliable predictions of regional climate change, including the statistics of extreme events and high impact weather, which are required for global and local adaptation strategies. http://heron.directrouter.co.uk/~itfnvazy/hrcm/

The Weather and Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Modelling Panel (WMP) recently concluded that â€œregional projections from the current generation of climate models were sufficiently uncertain to compromise the goal of providing society with reliable predictions of regional climate change. Therefore, a major recommendation by the group was that, to meet the expectations of society, it is both necessary and possible to revolutionise climate prediction.

adaptation strategies require more accurate and reliable predictions of regional weather and climate extreme events than are possible with the current generation of climate models

It is possible:
    1. because of major advances in scientific understanding
    2. because of the development of seamless prediction systems which unify weather and climate prediction, thus bringing the insights and constraints of weather prediction into the climate change arena
    3. because of the ever-expanding power of computers
