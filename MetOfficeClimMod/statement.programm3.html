As well as my experience driving vegetation and fire models using parallel computing, I have attended training courses on code structure and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems on an HPC platform. I have applied the programming principles these courses introduced into my code development of projects (e.g. see http://douglask3.github.io/firemip for my latest project)
