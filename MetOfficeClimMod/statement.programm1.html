<h2> Programming and Data Analysis Skills </h2>
<h3>Good scientific computing skills, ideally with experience of automation through scripting languages (such as Perl and python) and of numerical analysis </h3>
The LPX model <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014a </citep>, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. Handling the data used to constrain and drive this model has provided a wealth of experience with shell scripting for data file organisation, and statistical and GIS programming for analysis (e.g Python, R, Matlab, IDL, ArcGIS and its open source equivalents). I have published some of my statistical code independently as software packages available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> â€“ both available from <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/tools" target ="_blank">http://douglask3.github.io/tools</a>), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).
