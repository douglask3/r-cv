For my PhD in climate change I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain  models of terrestrial biosphere processes <citep>Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Kelley2014a; Kelley</citep>. I have driven some of these models with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of future climate change on biosphere dynamics, including ecosystem resilience, the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire/drought disturbances and resultant carbon emissions <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Zeppel2014; Harrisonc</citep>, and hydrology </citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis (available here: <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf</a>) was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.
