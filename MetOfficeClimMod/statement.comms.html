<h3> Evidence of good written and oral communication skills </h3>
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conferences, visits, and internal departmental presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my department's annual postgraduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulations of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting <citep> kelley2013implications </citep>.
