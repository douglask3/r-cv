Dear Professor Lesley Gray

I am writing to enquire about the position of “Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Climate Modelling”  inverstigating decadal influence of the solar cycle on stratospheric variability, and it's impacts on the Earth’s weather and climate. My research experience covers the key skills outlined in the job specification, and I have recently completed a PhD in climate change (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) which explored the impacts of weather and climate on the biosphere. I was wondering if you would condiser an applicant from a climate science background other than atmopsheric physics for this position. Below I have outline my revelent skills I honed during my PhD below, followed by my movitation for wanting to study drivers of climate.

For my PhD I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain complex numerical models of land surface processes (Kelley et al. 2013; Kaminski et al. 2013 ;Kelley et al. 2014; Kelley et al. in prep). I have driven some of these model with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of future climate change on bioshphere dynamics (Kelley & Harrison, 2014; Harrison and Kelley submitted; Ukkola et al. Submitted; Hanston et al. in prep); and to explore the impacts of teleconections between ENSO and regional climate variablity on fire-vegetation disturbance and its resultant emission (Kelley, 2008; Prentice et al. 2011).

My experience with complex numerical models means I well versed in most widley used programming languages, incluing C, C++ and FORTRAN, and am used to working in linux enviroments. The large amounts of observational data that goes into contraining, evaluting and driving these models has given me plenty of experience working with shell-scripting for data file organisation as well many statistical programming languaages and GIS products (e.g Python, R, matlab, IDL, ArCGIS and its open source equivalents). Independantly, I have started developing some of my statistical code as software-packages avaiable for anyone to download and use (e.g. Kelley, 2015; Kelley, 2016), one of which is already been implemented as part of a model intercomparison project (Hanston et al. In prep). I am used to using version control systems (e.g. subvions and git) as a result of my model and software package development.

 I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conference, workshops, visits, and internal department presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was won a travel grant to present simulation of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting  (Kelley et al. 2013). See attached cv for pull publiucation and presentation record.

During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from conclusion of the consultancy work I was involved in  with the RSCN in Jordon, prior to my PhD. This student has recently completed. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

Involvement in research collaborations across institutions (e.g. Kelley et al. 2013) and disciplines (e.g. Harrison et al. 2014), and even outside of academic (Harrison and Kelley, 2010) has sharpened my ability to manage projects efficiently.

Many of the predicted impacts from my research on terrestrial biosphere dyanamics contain important colnculsion for mitigation and adaptation policies for future climate change (Kelley et al. 2014; Harrison & Kelley submitted; Ukkola et el. submitted). However, these impact "forecasts" are still largely qualitative due to uncertainties in the predicatibility of climate variability and their impact on localised weather extremes (e.g. Friedlingstein et al. 2005; Kelley 2014; Harrison and Kelley submitted). Recently, there has been some promising results at exploreing inherent predictability in natural variabtions in the climate system and it's potenital impacts on near-term (upto a decade) weather extreme (<<ref Jons?>>). However, there is still many feedbacks that are either highly uncterain or are not included in current climate simulations

 Impacts of the stratosphere on surface weather, should have easily predicatble controls on lower climate and weather.

And recent research from you group and other institutions has demonstrated significant influence of the solar activity from the sun-spot cycle on startospheric temputure profiles (both directly?? and from UV modulated Ozone abosrobtion), with increase warming at low-latutude, medium-high stratosphere increasing <<stability>> and decreasing preciptiation … << from website>>. ….

I have gained experience at … through my MSc in Earth System Science, and studied the impacts of atmopsheric … during my physics undergtrad. I would love to be able to combine the knowledge I picked up during these degrees with my climate scince research skills I developed during my PhD.

I hope that you consder my climate resea …
I have attached my CV.

Thank you for you consideration.

Douglas Kelley.
