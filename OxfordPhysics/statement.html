Dear Professor Lesley Gray

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Climate Modelling”, investigating decadal influence of the solar cycle on stratospheric variability, and it's impacts on the Earth’s weather and climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I utilised experimental and satellite data to develop and constrain a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestial biosphere dynamics <citep>Kelley2014</citep>. The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the essential skills outlined in the job specification, and my MSc in Earth Systems Science provides background knowledge of climate processes and climate dynamics. Below I have outline the revelent skills I honed during my PhD, followed by my movitation for studying the influance of solar irradiance on climate.



<h2> Climate Science Research </h2>
<!--
Excellent foundation in mathematical and physics sciences
- A PhD (or close to obtaining) in a relevant scientific research topic
- PhD and/or postdoctoral experience in climate dynamics
Background knowledge and understanding of climate processes
Excellent track record in performing scientific analysis
Previous experience in climate modelling
-->
For my PhD I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain complex numerical models of land surface processes <citep>Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Kelley2014a; Kelley</citep>. I have driven some of these model with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of teleconections between ENSO and regional climate variablity on fire-vegetation disturbance and its resultant emission <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011</citep>; and to explore the impacts of future climate change on bioshphere dynamics, including ecyostsem resilience, the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire and drought disturnaces <citep>Zeppel2014; Harrisonc</citep>, and hydrology </citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis (available here: <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf </a>) was well recived by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

My MSc in Earth System Science provided a broader overview of the Earth and climate system, with an emptahsis on climate modelling and feedbacks. On this course, I was given the oppertunity to write my own simple climate-box model, and gained experiance driving a GCM (MITgcm) and Earth System (e.g. GENIE) model. Our module on climate drivers also included influances of variations in solar irradience on past climate and current climate variability.

<h2> Computing and technical skills </h2>
<!--
Good computing and technical skills
Excellent skills in problem-solving, decision-making and organising
-->
The LPX model <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014a </citep>, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. Handling the data used to constrain and drive this model has given me plenty of experience with shell-scripting for data file organisation, and statistical and GIS programming for analysis (e.g Python, R, Matlab, IDL, ArcGIS and its open source equivalents). I have published some of my statistical code independently as software packages available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).


<h2> Communication and publication </h2>
<!--
Good communications skills
-->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which are first authored - and I have a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conferences, visits, and internal department presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my department's annual post-graduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulations of future climate impacts at the AGU <citep> kelley2013implications </citep>.

During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in my research group who were new to statistical programming. And before starting my PhD, I gave seminars on vegetation disturbance and assisted on a masters course in scientific programming for beginners.

<h2> Worky Stuff </h2>
<!--
Demonstrable ability for independent research initiative
Excellent skills in problem-solving, decision-making and organising
-->
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD, which has sharpened my ability to manage projects efficiently. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>. Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordancitep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.


<h2> Motivation </h2>
<!--
Background knowledge and understanding of climate processes
Track record of science research in the impacts of stratospheric influence and/or solar
influence on weather and climate
-->

Many of the predicted impacts from my research on terrestrial biosphere dynamics contain important conclusions for mitigation and adaptation policies for future climate change. However, these impact "forecasts" are still largely qualitative due to uncertainties in the predictability of climate variability (e.g. <cite>Friedlingstein2005; kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</cite>). Recently, there has been some promising results at exploring inherent predictability in near-term natural variations in the climate system,  mainly exploring ground and troposphere forcings/feedback on lower-atoperhere climate (i.e sea surfance tempurature/pressure oscillations: ??ref jons??). Influances of the stratosphere, which itself contains highly predicatble vatriabiloty <<ref>>, on lower tropsophere and surface weather and climate is still a relativilty new and uncertain field <<ref>> <<climate models>>, and is a promising avenue of research to futher enhance near term prejections of climate variability. Your groups work on exploring and diagnosing inherent teleconnections with the stratosphere and climate in earth system/climate models will thus help further constrain future predictions of climate – vital for more quantitative predictions of climate impacts much needed to help adaptation policies.

I find the question of the impacts of solar irradiance cycles on climate particularly interesting because of my pre-PhD studies. The most exciting component of my MSc in Earth System Science looked at impacts of sunspot cycles on climate, and I have a continued interest in anything extraplanetary from my BSc in Physics. I would relish the opportunity to combine the knowledge I picked up during these degrees with my climate science research skills I developed during my PhD.


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that my climate research and numerical modelling experience, programming and climate data analysis skills, is well suited to the role.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
