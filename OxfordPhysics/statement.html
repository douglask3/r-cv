Dear Professor Lesley Gray

I am writing to enquire about the position of “Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Climate Modelling”  inverstigating decadal influence of the solar cycle on stratospheric variability, and it's impacts on the Earth’s weather and climate. My research experience covers the key skills outlined in the job specification, and I completed a PhD in climate change just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) which explored the impacts of weather and climate on the terrestial biosphere. I was wondering if you would condiser an applicant from a climate science background other than atmopsheric physics for this position.

For my PhD I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental data to develop and constrain complex numerical models of land surface processes, some of which I have driven with climate observations and future climate model outputs to explore the impacts of  climate change on bioshphere-fire dynamics and teleconections between ENSO and regional climate variablity on fire-vegetation disturbance and its resultant emission.  My experience with these models means I well versed in most widley used programming languages, incluing C, C++ and FORTRAN, and am used to working in linux enviroments. Handelling the data for contraining and driving these models has given me plenty of experience working with shell-scripting for data file organisation, statistical programming languages and GIS products for analysis (e.g Python, R, matlab, IDL, ArCGIS and its open source equivalents). I have puslished some of my statistical code idependantly as software-packages avaiable for anyone to download and use (see http://douglask3.github.io/tools).

I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored and with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conference, visits, and internal department presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my departments annual post-graduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulation of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting in 2013. Involvement in research collaborations across institutions and disciplines, and even outside of academic has sharpened my ability to manage projects efficiently.

During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days. Before starting my PhD, I gave seminar on fire disturbance and scientific programming for beginners on Masters Courses.

Many of the predicted impacts from my research on terrestrial biosphere dyanamics contain important colnculsion for mitigation and adaptation policies for future climate change. However, these impact "forecasts" are still largely qualitative due to uncertainties in the predicatibility of climate variability. Recently, there has been some promising results at exploreing inherent predictability in near-term natural variabtions in the climate system. Your groups work on exploreing and dignoising inherent connections with the stratosphere and climate in earth system/climate models will help futher constrain simulation of climate variability – vital for more quantative predictions of climate impacts muched needed to help adadation policies.

I find the question of the impacts of solar irradiance cycles on climate paticularly intertesting because of my pre-phd studies. The most exciting compenonent of my Msc in Earth System Science looked at impacts of sunspot cycles on climate,  and I have a continued interest in anything extraplanetary from my Physics BSc. I would relish the oppurtinuity to combine the knowledge I picked up during these degrees with my climate scince research skills I developed during my PhD.

Please let me know if you would consider a canditade with my ….


Thank you for you consideration.

Douglas Kelley.
