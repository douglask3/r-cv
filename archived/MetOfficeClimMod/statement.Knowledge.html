<h3> Understanding of climate projections and climate change </h3>
Many of the predicted impacts of my research have important consequences for mitigation <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and adaptation <citep>Ukkola; Harrisonc</citep> policies. However, these impact "forecasts" still remain largely qualitative due to uncertainties in future climate variability and their impact on localised weather extremes (e.g. <cite>Friedlingstein2006; robson2010understanding; Harrisonc</cite>). I have taken into account uncertainty in climate "scenarios" in these studies by using multiple RCPs and providing impact projections tied to specific changes in radiative forcing. Process uncertainty is quantified through the inclusion of multiple models, providing a "range" of realisations for each RCP and the ability to test if changes in impacts are robust and/or significant <citep> Kelley2014a; Harrisonc </citep>. However, there are two other types of uncertainty important for future forecasts of disturbance that require further research. The first, uncertainty in natural variations, is important only for near-term projections (e.g. <cite>hawkins2009potential</cite>). The second, uncertainty in weather extremes <citep>randall2007climate</citep>, is an issue for longer term future climate projections.

One reason why extreme weather is poorly resolved in climate models is because it is largely caused by sub-grid level processes compared to the resolution that climate models are traditional run at (i.e extreme lighting and rain from convective storms). However, recent advances in scientific understanding of unified weather and climate prediction, and computing power provide the opportunity to explore much finer scale regional future climate simulations which could provide invaluable information to aid adaptation strategies. I would relish the opportunity to apply the experience I gained from modelling climate change impacts to the challenge of improving our predictive understanding of changes in extreme weather - vital for climate change adaptations.
