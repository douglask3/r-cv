I have recently completed a PhD in climate change where I developed and constrained a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestrial biosphere dynamics <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>.  The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the skills outlined in the job specification. My MSc in Earth System Science provides a broader overview of the Earth and climate system, with an emphasis on climate modelling and feedbacks. During my MSc, I was given the opportunity to write my own simple climate-box model and gained experience driving a GCM (MITgcm) and the ocean component of an Earth System Model (GENIE). The module on natural hazards also included the impact of future changes in climate variability on the incidence of fire and storms.
