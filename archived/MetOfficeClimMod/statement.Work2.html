<h3>Evidence of capability to work in a highly collaborative environment both internally and externally, with good inter-personal skills </h3>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

During my PhD, my excellent inter-personal skills enabled me to act as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming. and volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days - both of which show how well I work with others, for the benefit of the group as a whole.

In addition, I was also involved in an external international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society with the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.
