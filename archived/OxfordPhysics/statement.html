Dear Professor Lesley Gray

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Climate Modelling”, investigating the decadal influence of the solar cycle on stratospheric variability, and its impacts on the Earth’s weather and climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I utilised experimental and satellite data to develop and constrain a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestrial biosphere dynamics <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>. The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the essential skills outlined in the job specification, and my MSc in Earth Systems Science provides background knowledge of climate processes and climate dynamics. Below I have outlined the relevant skills I honed during my PhD, followed by my motivation for studying the influence of solar irradiance variations on climate.


<!--
Excellent foundation in mathematical and physics sciences
- A PhD (or close to obtaining) in a relevant scientific research topic
- PhD and/or postdoctoral experience in climate dynamics
Background knowledge and understanding of climate processes
Excellent track record in performing scientific analysis

<h2> Climate Science Research </h2>
For my PhD I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain complex numerical models of land surface processes <citep>Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Kelley2014a; Kelley</citep>. I have driven some of these models with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of teleconnections between ENSO and regional climate variability on fire-vegetation disturbance and its resultant emission <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011</citep>, and to explore the impacts of future climate change on biosphere dynamics, including ecosystem resilience, the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire and drought disturbances <citep>Zeppel2014; Harrisonc</citep>, and hydrology </citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis (available here: <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf</a>) was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

My MSc in Earth System Science provided a broader overview of the Earth and climate system, with an emphasis on climate modelling and feedbacks. During my MSc, I was given the opportunity to write my own simple climate-box model and gained experience driving a GCM (MITgcm) and an Earth System Model (GENIE). The module on climate drivers also included influences of variations in solar irradiance on past climate and current climate variability.

<h2> Computing and technical skills </h2>
The LPX model <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014a </citep>, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. Handling the data used to constrain and drive this model has provided a wealth of experience with shell-scripting for data file organisation, and statistical and GIS programming for analysis (e.g Python, R, Matlab, IDL, ArcGIS and its open source equivalents). I have published some of my statistical code independently as software packages available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/tools" target ="_blank">http://douglask3.github.io/tools</a>), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

Good communications skills

<h2> Communication and publication </h2>
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conferences, visits, and internal departmental presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my department's annual postgraduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulations of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting <citep> kelley2013implications </citep>.

During my PhD, I acted as chair for my research groups paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in my research group who were new to statistical programming. Prior to starting my PhD, I gave seminars on vegetation disturbance and taught scientific programming for beginners at masters level.

<h2> Work organisation </h2>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD, which has sharpened my ability to manage projects efficiently. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>. Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

<h2> Motivation </h2>
Many of the predicted impacts from my research on terrestrial biosphere dynamics contain important conclusions for mitigation and adaptation policies for future climate change (eg. <cite> Kelley2014b; Ukkola; Harrisonc</cite>). However, these impact "forecasts" are still largely qualitative due to uncertainties in the predictability of climate variability (e.g. <cite>Friedlingstein2006; kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</cite>). Exploring the influences of the stratosphere on lower troposphere and surface weather and climate is still a relatively new and uncertain field <citep>Gray2010; Ermolli2013</citep>, but is proving to be a promising avenue of<NewPage> research to further reduce uncertainties in near-term projections of climate variability <citep>Hardiman2012; Manzini2014</citep>. Your groups work on exploring and diagnosing inherent teleconnections with the stratosphere and climate in earth system/climate models will thus help further constrain future predictions of climate – vital for more quantitative predictions of climate impacts, and much needed to help adaptation policies.

I find the question of the impacts of solar irradiance cycles on climate particularly interesting because of my pre-PhD studies. The most exciting component of my MSc in Earth System Science looked at impacts of sunspot cycles on climate, and I have a continued interest in anything extra-planetary from my BSc in Physics. I would relish the opportunity to combine the knowledge I gained during these degrees with the climate science research skills I developed during my PhD.



Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my climate research and numerical modelling experience, and my programming and climate data analysis skills, I am well suited to the role.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and/or email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
