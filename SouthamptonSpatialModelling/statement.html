Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “xxxx” as part of the SCALEFORES project.


I have recently completed a PhD in climate change ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based GIS observations to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resiliance, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire regimes <citep>Harrisonc</citep>, drought and hydrology <citep>Zeppel2014; Ukkola</citep>. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techinqiues designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation descisions that, by nesciccity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques, particularly in parts of the world most vulnerabile to future enviromental change. By utilising scale-dependancy of relationship between different ESs, SCALEFORS will help develope accurate ways to map these hotspots even in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD to contribute to a research project that will help bridge such an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground observation, climate observations and climate model output. To do this, I have used a range of statistical and GIS software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R and R statistical packages, Python and matlab. More detail on this can be found in the "support statment" section of this application.

My PhD and subsequant post-doctural work involved a number of research collaborations<!--
Excellent verbal and written communication and presentation skills.
The ability to present research results and contribute to papers in high quality journals
Able to address small and large groups and cross-disciplinary groups at projects meetings
Able to synthesise information from meetings and write good notes.
Availability to attend national and international conferences and meetings to present research results and a willingness to travel occasionally for up to a week at a time to meet project partners.
<h2> Collaborations </h2>-->. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups <citep>Hantson2016</citep>. <!--I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.-->

I was also involved in a consultancy programme preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.  I also acted as chair for my research groups' research discussion meetings, and was an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming.

Whilst at Bristol, I volneteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summaizing scientific information and recoding decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my experiance in vegetation modelling and spatial statistical analysis, I am well suited to the role. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
