Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “xxxx” as part of the SCALEFORES project.


I have recently completed a PhD in climate change ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based GIS observations to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resiliance, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire regimes <citep>Harrisonc</citep>, drought and hydrology <citep>Zeppel2014; Ukkola</citep>. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techinqiues designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail annd accuracy required for conservation descisions that, by nesciccity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques, particularly in parts of the world most vunrable to future enviromental change. By utilising scale-dependancy of relationship between different ESs, SCALEFORS will help develope accurate ways to map these hotspots even in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD to contribute to a research project that will help bridge such an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

Below, I have briefly summarize my experience in ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis, described in more detail in the "supporting statement" section of the application. I then describe how my past experiance matches to futher specification outlines in the "Job Description and Person Specification" document. I have also atatched a full publication list and CV for futher information.


<h2> Ecological Modelling and Spatial Data Analysis </h2>.

I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.


<!--Excellent verbal and written communication and presentation skills. -->
<!--The ability to present research results and contribute to papers in high quality journals -->
<!--Able to address small and large groups and cross-disciplinary groups at projects meetings -->
<!--Able to synthesise information from meetings and write good notes. -->
<!--Availability to attend national and international conferences and meetings to present research results and a willingness to travel occasionally for up to a week at a time to meet project partners. -->
<h2> Collaborations </h2>
I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups, partiually because I have shared the main compoenets of the system as a statistical R package <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. <!--I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.-->

I was also involved in a consultancy programme preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>. I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).



<h2> Research Group Stuff </h2>
<!-- Experience of working closely in a small research team.-->
<!-- Able to motivate, train and enthuse students -->
<!--Positive attitude to colleagues and students -->
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming.


<h2> Ecological Modelling and Spatial Data Analysis </h2>
My PhD in Climate Change Ecology explored future changes in ecosystem composition and prcoesses, and it's impact on future services such as carbon storage, fire enhancment or supression and hydrologyin Australia. I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>).

I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

<h2> Work organisation </h2>
<!-- Expertise in designing research on spatial questions.  Able to organise own programme of work and resources to meet deadlines -->

<h2> Communication and Collaboration </h2>
<!--Excellent verbal and written communication and presentation skills. -->

I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.

I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, and was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see CV for a full list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>. I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).



In my own time, I designed my running clubs website  (www.eppingdac.com.au), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.

I am preparing applications for the positions of “Research Fellow in Spatial Modelling” and "Research Fellow in Applied Biogeography" linked with the SCALEFORES project, and I have a few questions regarding the research the roles will be performing, and about the job itself. First off, may I offer my congragulations for obtaining the ERC state up grant for such an exciting and facinating project. Information on ecostsem function and service value will be vital for both mitigation stratagies <!--(i.e through <<>> such as carbon storage)--> and adpation policies to <<>> future enbviromental change. Your recent work on quantifying unicertainty in many of the techinaues used to map sevices shows how far we still have to go to identify specific 'hotspots' for protection, particualrly with <<>> of future land-use and climate change. This is why the SCALEFORES project is so timely and important.

I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) which used remote sensed, ground based observations and experimantal data to develope a vegetation model to simulate vegetation and terrestial processed in Australia. I used this model to assess and project ecosystem reliance and changes to future climate change, with a focus on exploring effects of future ecosysem proertises on services such as carbon storage and hydrology. As a dominant and (in terms of vegetation modleling context) under-study control of vegetation in Australia is fire, the model devlopment component of my thesis focuessed on improving simulation of fire and vegetation adpatation to fire. This involved site analysisng land cover, soil and climate controls on primary observations of plant and ecosystem traits, <<modelled surface>> <<proxy maps>>. I have therefore had extensive practice using ENVI and GIS softerware (inc. ArcGIS and its open source equivalents) in anyalysing remote sensed and land-surface GIS data. I have also used R and any of its GIS and statistical packages (and indeed have developed some R packages myself: <<link>>) for statitical analysis of ecosystem traits and modelled vegatation.
