Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “xxxx” as part of the SCALEFORES project.


I have recently completed a PhD in climate change ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based GIS observations to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resiliance, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire regimes <citep>Harrisonc</citep>, drought and hydrology <citep>Zeppel2014; Ukkola</citep>. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techinqiues designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail annd accuracy required for conservation descisions that, by nesciccity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques, particularly in parts of the world most vunrable to future enviromental change. By utilising scale-dependancy of relationship between different ESs, SCALEFORS will help develope accurate ways to map these hotspots even in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD to contribute to a research project that will help bridge such an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

Below, I have briefly summarize my experience in ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis, described in more detail in the "supporting statement" section of the application. I then describe how my past experiance matches to futher specification outlines in the "Job Description and Person Specification" document. I have also atatched a full publication list and CV for futher information.


<h2> Ecological Modelling and Spatial Data Analysis </h2>.

I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.


<!--Excellent verbal and written communication and presentation skills. -->
<!--The ability to present research results and contribute to papers in high quality journals -->
<!--Able to address small and large groups and cross-disciplinary groups at projects meetings -->
<!--Able to synthesise information from meetings and write good notes. -->
<!--Availability to attend national and international conferences and meetings to present research results and a willingness to travel occasionally for up to a week at a time to meet project partners. -->
<h2> Collaborations </h2>
I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups, partiually because I have shared the main compoenets of the system as a statistical R package <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. <!--I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.-->

I was also involved in a consultancy programme preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>. I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).


Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my climate research and numerical modelling experience, and my programming and climate data analysis skills, I am well suited to the role.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and/or email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
