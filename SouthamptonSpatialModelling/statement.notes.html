This grouped ecosystem services into four broad categories: provisioning, such as the production of food and water; regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; supporting, such as nutrient cycles and crop pollination; and cultural, such as spiritual and recreational benefits

I am preparing applications for the positions of “Research Fellow in Spatial Modelling” and "Research Fellow in Applied Biogeography" linked with the SCALEFORES project, and I have a few questions regarding the research the roles will be performing, and about the job itself. First off, may I offer my congragulations for obtaining the ERC state up grant for such an exciting and facinating project. Information on ecostsem function and service value will be vital for both mitigation stratagies <!--(i.e through <<>> such as carbon storage)--> and adpation policies to <<>> future enbviromental change. Your recent work on quantifying unicertainty in many of the techinaues used to map sevices shows how far we still have to go to identify specific 'hotspots' for protection, particualrly with <<>> of future land-use and climate change. This is why the SCALEFORES project is so timely and important.

My PhD in Climate Change Ecology explored future changes in ecosystem composition and prcoesses, and it's impact on future services such as carbon storage, fire enhancment or supression and hydrologyin Australia. I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

<!--

I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) which used remote sensed, ground based observations and experimantal data to develope a vegetation model to simulate vegetation and terrestial processed in Australia. I used this model to assess and project ecosystem reliance and changes to future climate change, with a focus on exploring effects of future ecosysem proertises on services such as carbon storage and hydrology. As a dominant and (in terms of vegetation modleling context) under-study control of vegetation in Australia is fire, the model devlopment component of my thesis focuessed on improving simulation of fire and vegetation adpatation to fire. This involved site analysisng land cover, soil and climate controls on primary observations of plant and ecosystem traits, <<modelled surface>> <<proxy maps>>. I have therefore had extensive practice using ENVI and GIS softerware (inc. ArcGIS and its open source equivalents) in anyalysing remote sensed and land-surface GIS data. I have also used R and any of its GIS and statistical packages (and indeed have developed some R packages myself: <<link>>) for statitical analysis of ecosystem traits and modelled vegatation.
