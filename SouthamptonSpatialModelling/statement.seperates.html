I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground based GIS observations and experimantal data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep> <!--to help improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and vegetation-disturbance interactions in Australia <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>.-->. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resliance to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composiotion, processes and services. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilance, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and water rescources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking earth system processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem service valuation - both through assigning monartary value, similar work by <citet>costanza1997value</citet>, or though other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep>Kelley2008</citep>. I found this the most fascinating aspect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and soical policy, and it had a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

<!--Experience in spatial and/or ecological modelling -->
I have been the lead developer of the LPX-DGVM for that last 6 years <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</citep>. This model is driven with spatially distributed monthly climate, land use and soils inputs as well as atompsheric CO2 concentrations in order to simulate terrestial bioshphere processes. Vegetation is split along descrete plant functioanl types (PFTS). These PFTS establish if climate is within their tolarated ranges, grow, compete with other established PFTs for resources, and are killed via light competition, carbon limitation, and disturbance (e.g. fire). The mix of PFTs found in each location allows assessment of broad vegetation types or biome <citep>Sitch2003</citep>. The model also simulates vegetation productivity, vegetation-driven carbon cycle, the impact of vegetation and climate on fire and the water cycle abnd many more processes. Most of my work with LPX has foccussed on development of the fire disturbance component and fire-vegetation interactions. This has involved parameterization of phyical processes such as incorporaton of a lighnting ignition algorithm and fuel drying times <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, and ecological processes such as vegetation fuel production, fuel decomponsition, and modelling plant traits to for fire protection (such as evolutionary driven changes in bark thickness) and recovery (such as competation between rapidly estatilishing plants and resprouting plants) <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrisonc</citep>. As well as development of the fire component, I have also worked on competition between grass PFTs and plant root profiles in order to improve representation of vegetation in semi-arid ecosystem. Improvment of the model allowed me to assess and seperate climate and vegetation interactions with fire and hydrology. This included counter-intuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying regions, further compounding predicted drought <citep>Ukkola</citep>; and that changes in the likelihood of fire events is dependent on the complex interactions between climate amd vegetation composition/productivity - not just climate by itself <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>.

I have experiance developing and using other spatial ecological models besides LPX (and its pre-curser, LPJ-GLOBFIRM: <cite>Sitch2003; Kelley2013</cite>). I have coded and driven the Simple Diognostic Biosphere Model (SDBM), which calculates productivity of and water use by vegetation based on simple relationships with remote-sensed vegetative land-surface propertises. I used this model as an evaulation tool of carbon and water-dynamics in more complex terrestial bioshophere models, as a away off asseing the impact of vegetation-parameter choice on ecosystem productivity <cite>Kelley2013</cite>, and to assess the affects of vegetetaion productivity and fuel moisture limitation on burnt area <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>. I have also worked on the vegetation model (BETHY) in the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) which calculates likely values of key ecologicl and Earth System model parameters based on piro estimates and model optimization against spatially-distributed remote sensed land-surface and site based carbon flux obsverations <citep>Kelley2008; kaminski2013bethy</citep>. Recently, I have been involved in projects exploreing plant allocation and phenology stratagies using a simple, site-based ecological model (GDAY: <<gitbhub>>).

The LPX model combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) with a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models in R, C, Python and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>, and have performed statistical analysis and plotting in R, Python, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL.

I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

As a major part of this thesis, I developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of multiple aspects of the simulated vegetation, hydrology, disturbance regimes and ecosystem fluxes in vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. This system uses multiple spatial and temporal datasets - many of which I created from romote sensed observations - and applies statistical metrics (normalised mean (squared) error, taxi-cab and square chord distances plus metrics I designed myself to assess temporal performance) to quantify the "distance" between simulated and obsveraved variables. These metrics are normalised in such away as to allow comparison between model processes. I also designed two 'null' models to set benchmarks of minimum experected performance which aids interpretation of metrioc scores. This benchmarking system serves several purposes: (1) it quantifies how well a model performs across a comprehensive range of important processes; (2) it allows the identification of model weaknesses through comparison of the performance with respect to different benchmarks and thus facilitates the identification of processes that require improvement; (3) it quantifies the differences between model versions, which allows assessment of the overall impact of new parameterizations.

Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key geographic areas and prcoesses of model weakness and formed the basis of model devlopment throughout the rest of my thesis. I have since made the metrics and null models into R-package a freely avaiable for anyone to download and use <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. The system has also been adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

I was a lead collabrotator on a project that aimed to determine climate and disturbance controls on prevelance of plant resprouting ability (RS) and type <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>. This involved the creation of a database of site-based species inventories to determine indicies of RS abuncance and species richness. These indicies of abundance where compared against climate and disturbance variables which selcted after assessing co-correlation between variables using rundancy analysis. I used a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) approuch to indetify and quantify variables that control RS. This analysis demstrated the importance RS as a recovcery trait to intermediate-intensity and resonably frequant (10 - 100 years) fires, and was used to guide and evaluate incorpration of post-fire reprouting into LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrison</citep>. It also showed high abundance of specific types of RS in areas of highly variable and unreliable rainfall, which has spawning research into RS as a recovery adpatation to drought <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>.

In the introduction of my thesis, I again used the GLM approuch with a simple statistical fire-limitation model  I developed to described the maximum expected byurnt area for three key components of fire: plant productivity (proxy for fuel load); aridity (for fuel moisture); and lightning (ignitions). I used the GLM to determine components and residuals of each of the three variables in order to map the contribution of each limitation (i.e, too little fuel, too wet, or too little ignitions) to the control of fire in Australia (Figure 1.6 - <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>).

<!-- Some expertise in GIS and data handling -->
<!-- Experience in using GIS (i.e ArcGIS) to analyse large geospatial datasets -->
My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing anad analysing many large-scale geospatial datasets wih a range of GIS software. Remote-sensed observations used in my vegetation model benchmark system were processed in R using raster, sp, maptools and rgeos packages and their dependancies. The benchmark software package I developed for statistical model comparisons (outlines above) incorporates the raster and sp packages into its statistical calculations. I have also used R spatial packages to extract data points of remote-sensed and climate data for incoprtation into the RS site database described above, and I used ArcGIS to extract vegetation and soil type information for these sites from vector datasets (the National Vegetation Information system and ASRIS Atlas of Australian Soils). I also used ArcGIS to construct maps of water-holding capcity, percolation rates and thermal diffusivity of soils based on ASRIS maps. I have since repeated this anaylysis using QGIS - an open source GIS software product.

During a coarse on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movmewnt and concebntrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spretrum, split-window techinques uning ENVI/IDL programming. I also used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cload) and to construct multi-band fire indicies from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>.

I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD (<citep>Kelley2014a</citep>) by comparing remote sensed LIS lighting flash count data to ground, point-based lighting strikes observtations in order to determine if induvidual flashes where iter-cloud ot cloud to ground. This invloved determining location of strikes in sattalite data and matching point-based ground observations using matlabs HDF package. I have since repateated this anayalis using raster and GIS packages in R.

    I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.
