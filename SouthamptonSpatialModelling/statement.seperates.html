I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground based GIS observations and experimantal data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep>. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resliance to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composiotion, processes and services in Australia. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilance, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and water rescources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking earth system processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem service valuation - both through assigning monartary value, similar work by <citet>costanza1997value</citet>, or though other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep>Kelley2008</citep>. I found this the most fascinating aspect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and soical policy, and it had a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

<!--Experience in spatial and/or ecological modelling -->
I have been the lead developer of the LPX-DGVM for that last 6 years <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</citep>. This model is driven with spatially distributed monthly climate, land use and soils inputs as well as atompsheric CO2 concentrations in order to simulate terrestial bioshphere processes. Vegetation is split into plant functioanl types (PFTS). These PFTS establish if climate is within their tolarated ranges, grow, compete with other established PFTs for resources, and are killed via light competition, carbon limitation, and disturbance. The mix of PFTs found in each location allows assessment of broad vegetation types <citep>Sitch2003</citep>. The model also simulates vegetation productivity, and the impact of vegetation and climate carbon and water cycles, fire and many more processes. Most of my work with LPX has foccussed on development of fire-vegetation interactions<!--. This has involved parameterization of phyical processes such as incorporaton of a lighnting ignition algorithm and fuel drying times <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, and ecological processes--> such as fuel production, fuel decomponsition, and incorporating plant traits to for fire protection (e.g. evolutionary driven changes in bark thickness) and recovery (such as competation between rapidly estatilishing plants and resprouting plants) <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrisonc</citep>. I have also worked on modelling plant root profiles and grass PFT competition in order to improve representation of vegetation in semi-arid ecosystem. The improved model allowed me to seperate climate and vegetation influances on fire and hydrology. This included counter-intuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: changes in the likelihood of fire events is dependent on the complex interactions between climate and vegetation composition/productivity - not just climate by itself <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>; and that CO2-related increases in vegetation  may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying regions, further compounding predicted drought <citep>Ukkola</citep>.

I have experiance developing and using other spatial ecological models besides LPX. I have coded and driven the Simple Diognostic Biosphere Model (SDBM), which calculates productivity of and water use by vegetation based on simple relationships with remote-sensed vegetative land-surface propertises. I used this model as an evaulation tool of carbon and water-dynamics in complex terrestial bioshophere models; as a away of asseing the impact of vegetation-parameter choice on ecosystem productivity <cite>Kelley2013</cite>, and to assess the affects of vegetetaion productivity and fuel moisture limitation on burnt area <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>. I have also worked on the vegetation model in the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System, which calculates likely values of key ecologicl and Earth System model parameters based on piro estimates and model optimization against spatially-distributed remote sensed land-surface and site based carbon flux obsverations <citep>Kelley2008; kaminski2013bethy</citep>. Recently, I have been involved in projects exploreing plant allocation and phenology stratagies using a simple, site-based ecological model (GDAY: <<gitbhub>>).

The LPX model combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) with a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models in R, C, Python and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>.

I conduct most of my statistical analysis and plotting in R, but I also used Python, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

As part of my thesis, I developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of multiple aspects of simulated vegetation, hydrology, disturbance regimes and ecosystem fluxes in vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. This system uses multiple datasets <!--- many of which I created from remote sensed observations - --> and applies statistical metrics (including normalised mean error, taxi-cab and metrics I designed myself) to quantify "distances" between simulated and obsveraved variables. These metrics are normalised in such away as to allow comparison between model processes. I also designed two 'null' models to set benchmarks for aiding interpretation of metric scores. Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key geographic areas and processes of model weakness which formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of this model development on performance.

I have since made the metrics and null models into R-package <!--a freely avaiable for anyone to download and use--> <citep>Kelley2015</citep>. The system has also been adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

I was a lead collabrotator on a project that aimed to determine climate and disturbance controls on prevelance of plant resprouting ability (RS) <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>. This involved the creation of a database of site-based species inventories to construct RS abuncance and species richness indicies. These indicies where compared against climate and disturbance variables which were selcted after testing for co-correlation using rundancy analysis. I used a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) approuch to indetify variables that control RS. This analysis demstrated the importance RS as a recovcery trait to specific fire-regimes, and was used to guide incorpration of post-fire reprouting into LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrison</citep>. It also showed high abundance of specific types of RS in areas of highly variable rainfall, which has spawning research into RS as a recovery adpatation to drought <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>.

In the introduction of my thesis, I again used a GLM to construct a simple statistical fire-limitation model describing the maximum expected burnt area for three key components of fire: fuel avavilablity, fuel moisture and ignitions. I used each components contribution and residuals to construct a map of the limitations of fire in Australia (Figure 1.6 - <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>).

<!-- Some expertise in GIS and data handling -->
<!-- Experience in using GIS (i.e ArcGIS) to analyse large geospatial datasets -->
My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing anad analysing many large-scale geospatial datasets wih a range of GIS software. Remote-sensed observations used in my vegetation model benchmark system were processed in R using raster, sp, maptools and rgeos packages and their dependancies. The benchmark software package I developed for statistical model comparisons (outlines above) incorporates the raster and sp packages into its statistical calculations. I have also used R spatial packages to extract data points of remote-sensed and climate data for incoprtation into the RS site database described above, and I used ArcGIS to extract vegetation and soil type information for these sites from vector datasets (the National Vegetation Information system and ASRIS Atlas of Australian Soils). I also used ArcGIS to construct maps of water-holding capcity, percolation rates and thermal diffusivity of soils based on ASRIS maps. I have since repeated this anaylysis using QGIS - an open source GIS software product.

During a coarse on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movmewnt and concebntrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spretrum, split-window techinques uning ENVI/IDL programming. I also used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cload) and to construct multi-band fire indicies from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>.

I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD (<citep>Kelley2014a</citep>) by comparing remote sensed LIS lighting flash count data to ground, point-based lighting strikes observtations in order to determine if induvidual flashes where iter-cloud ot cloud to ground. This invloved determining location of strikes in sattalite data and matching point-based ground observations using matlabs HDF package. I have since repateated this anayalis using raster and GIS packages in R.

    I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.
