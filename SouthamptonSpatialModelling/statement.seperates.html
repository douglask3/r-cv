I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground-based GIS observations and experimental data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep>. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resilience to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composition, processes and services in Australia. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and water resources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking earth system processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem service valuation - both through assigning a monetary value, similar work by <citet>costanza1997value</citet>, or through other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep>Kelley2008</citep>. I found this the most fascinating aspect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and social policy, and it had a major influence with the main aims of my PhD.

I have been the lead developer of the LPX-DGVM for that last 6 years <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</citep>. This model is driven by spatially distributed monthly climate, land use and soils inputs and atmospheric CO2 concentrations in order to simulate terrestrial biosphere processes. Vegetation is split into plant functional types (PFTS). These PFTS establish if the climate is within their tolerated ranges, grow, compete with other established PFTs for resources, and are killed via competition, carbon limitation, and disturbance. The mix of PFTs found in each location allows assessment of broad vegetation types. The model also simulates vegetation productivity, and the impact of vegetation and climate on carbon and water cycles, fire and many more processes. Most of my work with LPX has focused on the development of fire-vegetation interactions including fuel production, fuel decomposition, and incorporating vegetation traits for fire protection (e.g. evolutionary driven bark thickness) and recovery (e.g. competition between rapidly establishing and resprouting plants) <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrisonc</citep>. I have also worked on modelling plant root profiles and grass PFT competition in order to improve the representation of vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems. The improved model allowed me to separate climate and vegetation influence on fire and hydrology. This included counter-intuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: changes in the likelihood of fire events is dependent on the complex interactions between climate and vegetation composition/productivity - not just climate by itself <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>; and that CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying regions <citep>Ukkola</citep>.<NewPage>

I have experience with other spatial ecological models besides LPX. I have coded and driven a simple biosphere model, which calculates productivity of and water use by vegetation based on simple relationships with remote-sensed vegetative land-surface properties. I used this model as an evaluation tool of carbon and water dynamics in complex terrestrial biosphere models and as a way of assessing the impact of vegetation parameter choice on ecosystem productivity <cite>Kelley2013</cite>. I have also worked on the vegetation model in the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System, which calculates likely values of key ecological and Earth System model parameters based on prior estimates and model optimization against spatially-distributed remote sensed land-surface and site based carbon flux observations <citep>Kelley2008; kaminski2013bethy</citep>. Recently, I have been involved in projects exploring plant allocation and phenology strategies using GDAY - a simple, site-based ecological model <citep>Kelley</citep>.

The LPX model combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) with a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models in R, C, Python and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>.

I conduct most of my statistical analysis and plotting in R, but I also used Python, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

As part of my thesis, I developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of multiple aspects of simulated vegetation, hydrology, disturbance regimes and ecosystem fluxes in vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. This system applies statistical metrics (including normalised mean error, taxi-cab, and metrics I designed myself) to quantify "distances" between simulations and remote-sensed observations. These metrics are normalised in such a way as to allow comparison between model processes. I also designed two 'null' benchmark models for aiding interpretation of metric scores. Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness, formed the basis of model development throughout the rest of my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of model development on performance.

The system and associated R-package has been adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

I was a lead collaborator on the construction of a site-based database designed to determine climatic and fire regime controls on the prevalence of plant resprouting ability (RS) <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>. I selected possible control variables after testing for redundancy using principal component analysis, and quantified the degree of control of each component using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) in R.  This analysis demonstrated the importance RS as a recovery trait to specific fire regimes and was used to guide the incorporation of post-fire resprouting into LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrison</citep>. It also showed a high abundance of specific types of RS associated with areas of highly variable rainfall, which has spawning research into RS as a recovery adaptation to drought <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>.

In the introduction of my thesis, I again used a GLM to construct a simple statistical fire-limitation model describing the maximum expected burnt area for three key components of fire: fuel availability, fuel moisture, and ignitions. I used each components contribution and residuals to construct a map of the limitations of fire in Australia (Figure 1.6 - <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>).

I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. All my papers are high impact, as demonstrated by my h-index of 6 despite the majority of my papers being published within the last 3 years. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field (i.e Environmental Research Letters, Biogeosciences, New Phytologist).

<h3> Please provide details of your experience (if any) in using GIS (i.e ArcGIS) to analyse large geospatial datasets. </h3>
My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing and analysing many large-scale geospatial datasets with a range of GIS software. Remote-sensed observations used in my vegetation model benchmark system were processed in R using raster, sp, maptools and rgeos packages and their dependencies. The benchmark software package I developed for statistical model comparisons (outlines above) incorporates the raster and sp packages into its statistical calculations. I have also used R spatial packages to extract data points of remote-sensed and climate data for incorporation into the RS site database described above, and I used ArcGIS to extract vegetation and soil type information for these sites from vector datasets (the National Vegetation Information system and ASRIS Atlas of Australian Soils). I also used ArcGIS to construct maps of water-holding capacity, percolation rates and thermal diffusivity of soils based on ASRIS maps. I have since repeated this analysis using QGIS - an open source GIS software product.

During a coarse on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movement and concentrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spectrum, split-window technique's using ENVI/IDL programming. I also used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cloud) and to construct multi-band fire indices from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>.

I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD (<citep>Kelley2014a</citep>) by comparing remote sensed LIS lightning flash count data to ground, point-based lightning strikes observations in order to determine if individual flashes where inter-cloud or cloud to ground. This involved determining location of strikes in satellite data and matching point-based ground observations using Matlab's HDF package. I have since repeated this analysis using raster and GIS packages in R.
