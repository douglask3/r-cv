I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground-based GIS observations and experimental data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep>. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resilience to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composition, processes and services in Australia. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and water resources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking earth system processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem service valuation - both through assigning a monetary value, similar to <citet>costanza1997value</citet>, or through other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep>Kelley2008</citep>. I found this the most fascinating aspect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and social policy, and it had a major influence on the main aims of my PhD.

During my PhD, I developed an R-based benchmarking system which evaluates spatial and temporal patterns of multiple processes of simulated by vegetation models <citep>Kelley2013</citep>. The system uses specially designed metric to quantify "distances" between simulations and global remote-sensed observational datasets, and formed an essential part of model development in my thesis. Processing of the observational datasets included resampling high spatial and temporal resolution RAW satellite data onto coarser resolution model grid, applying land/sea/ice masks, and converting different file types (HDF, ASCII, tiff, img etc.) to a standard format (NetCDF) using raster, sp, maptools and rgeos packages in R. <!--I have also used other R-packages (maps, ????), including some of my own design (see publication list), for analysing and plotting results from this benchmark system, as well as results from other research projects (e.g. http://douglask3.github.io/my-best-plots.html). Application of this benchmarking system to LPX identified key areas of model weakness, formed the basis of model development throughout my thesis, and was used to assess the impact of model development on performance.  The system has been adopted by other modelling groups, and is currently being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches (fireMIP:<cite>Hantson; Hantson2016</cite>). <!--In doing so, they are also using my benchmarking system to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.-->

I was a lead collaborator on the construction of a site-based database designed to determine climatic and wildfire controls on the prevalence of plant resprouting ability (RS) <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>. I used R to extract data points from remote-sensed and climate observations, and ArcGIS to extract vegetation and soil information from vector datasets (the National Vegetation Information system and ASRIS Atlas of Australian Soils) for each of these sites. I selected possible control variables after testing for redundancy using principal component analysis and quantified the influence of each variable using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) in R. <!-- This analysis demonstrated the importance of RS in specific fire regimes and was used to guide the incorporation of post-fire RS  into LPX <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrison</citep>. It also showed an abundance of specific RS types associated with areas of highly variable rainfall, which has spawned research into RS as a recovery adaptation to drought <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>.-->This analysis demonstrated the importance RS as a recovery trait to specific fire regimes and was used to guide the incorporation of post-fire resprouting into LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a; Harrison</citep>. It also showed a high abundance of specific RS types associated with areas of highly variable rainfall, which has spawned research into RS as a recovery adaptation to drought <citep>Zeppel2014</citep>.

In my thesis introduction, I again used a GLM in R to construct a simple statistical fire model describing the maximum expected burnt area for three key components of fire: fuel availability, fuel moisture, and ignitions. I used each components contribution and residuals to construct a map of the limitations of fire in Australia (Figure 1.6 - <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>).

I have also used ArcGIS to construct maps of water-holding capacity, percolation rates and thermal diffusivity of soils based on the ASRIS maps in order to guide the development of below-ground processes in LPX. I have since repeated this analysis using QGIS - an open source GIS software product.

<h3> Please provide details of your publications in peer-reviewed international journals in a relevant field. </h3>
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field (i.e Environmental Research Letters, Biogeosciences, New Phytologist). Please see my attached publication list for more information. <!--During my PhD, I was also given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see publication list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>. I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).-->

The LPX model combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component), to which I have added a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used, coded and developed simple vegetation models in R, C, Python and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>.

I have developed some of my R-code into software packages now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).


<h3> Please provide details of your experience (if any) of using remote sensing software (e.g. ENVI) </h3>
I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> by comparing remote-sensed LIS lightning flash count data to point-based, ground lightning strike observations in order to determine if individual flashes were inter-cloud or cloud to ground. This involved determining location of strikes in satellite data and matching point-based ground observations using Matlab's HDF package. I have since repeated this analysis using raster and GIS packages in R.

In addition, during a course on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movement and concentrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spectrum, split-window technique's using ENVI/IDL programming. I also used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cloud), and to construct multi-band fire indices from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>.
