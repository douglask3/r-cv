I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground based GIS observations and experimantal data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep> <!--to help improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and vegetation-disturbance interactions in Australia <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>.-->. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resliance to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composiotion, processes and services. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep> kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</cite>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilance, carbon stocks <citep> Kelley2014b </citep> and water rescources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar work by <citet> , or though other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and soical <<>>, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

I have been the lead developer on the LPX-DGVM  for 6 years. Model development in the Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX: <cite>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</cite>) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), in which benchmarking against observations is used to identify areas for new data-driven parameterizations and then subsequently used to evaluate whether the implementation of these new parameterizations produces an overall improvement in model performance. This approach contrasts with the general tendency within the vegetation modelling community to focus evaluation on new components, for example, the evaluation of fire treatments within DGVMs using only observations of burnt area and/or fire carbon fluxes (see e.g. <cite>Li2012; Pfeiffer2013 </cite>). One reason for this partial approach to evaluation was the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system <cite>Luo2012</cite>). I therefore developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows quantitative evaluation of multiple aspects of simulated processes to identify specific model weaknesses and differences between model versions, allowing assessment of the overall impact of new parameterizations. This allowed me to target model development in my thesis . This system is now starting to be adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.


<<Data driven development>>
This involved site analysisng land cover, soil and climate controls on primary observations of plant and ecosystem traits, <<modelled surface>> <<proxy maps>>. I have therefore had extensive practice using ENVI and GIS softerware (inc. ArcGIS and its open source equivalents) in anyalysing remote sensed and land-surface GIS data. I have also used R and any of its GIS and statistical packages (and indeed have developed some R packages myself: <<link>>) for statitical analysis of ecosystem traits and modelled vegatation.


My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, such as raw and processed satellite data (see e.g. <cite>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; Kelley2014b</cite>); vector ground observation (<cite>Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</cite>); historical climate and climate reanalysis data <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>.




    I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field (i.e Enviromental Research Letters, Biogeosciences, New Phytologist).

The LPX model, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) with a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models in Python, R and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>, and have performed statistical analysis and plotting in Python, R, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages <citep> Kelley2015 </citep> has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, from raw and processed satellite data (see e.g. <cite>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; Kelley2014b</cite>); vector ground observation (<cite>Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</cite>); historical climate and climate reanalysis data <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>.

<h3> Please provide details of your experience (if any) of using remote sensing software (e.g. ENVI) </h3>
I have had experiance on working with high-resolution remote-sensed observations on multiple software platforms. During a coarse on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movmewnt and concebntrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spretrum, split-window techinques uning ENVI/IDL programming. I also derive fire indicies from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>. For this, I used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cload) and to construct multi-band indicies.

I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD (<citep>Kelley2014a</citep>) by comparing remote sensed LIS lighting flash count data to ground, point-based lighting strikes observtations in order to determine if induvidual flashes where iter-cloud ot cloud to ground. This invloved determining location of strikes in sattalite data and matching point-based ground observations using matlabs HDF package. I have since repateated this anayalis using raster and GIS packages in R.
