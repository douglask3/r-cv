<!-- PhD or equivalent qualifications and experience in Geography, Biology, Environmental Sciences, or related subject-->
I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) where I utilised remote sensed and ground-based GIS observations and experimental data to develop, constrain and evaluate Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Hantson</citep>. I used one of these models, the LPX-DGVM <citep>Kelley2014a</citep>, to assess ecosystem resilience to disturbance regimes <citep>Kelley2014a; Zeppel2014</citep> and to project the impact of future climate change on ecosystem composition, processes and services in Australia. For my thesis, this focussed on changes in vegetation-modulated future fire regimes and their associated impacts <citep>kelley2014modelling; Harrisonc</citep>, but I have since used the model to explore potential changes in future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and water resources <citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

The major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking earth system processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem service valuation - both through assigning a monetary value, similar to <citet>costanza1997value</citet>, or through other metrics such as biodiversity or carbon storage <citep>Kelley2008</citep>. I found this the most fascinating aspect of the masters programme, as it provided a direct link between ecological science and social policy, and it had a major influence on the main aims of my PhD.

<!--Proven experience in using GIS (i.e ArcGIS) and statistical software (i.e. R) to analyse large geospatial datasets -->
<!-- Advanced skills in GIS and data handling -->
<!-- some understanding of statistical analyses of large-scale datasets -->
<!-- Expertise in data analysis, including large data-sets using appropriate software -->
My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing and analysing many large-scale geospatial datasets with a range of GIS software. Remote-sensed observations used in my vegetation model benchmark system were processed in R using raster, sp, maptools and rgeos packages and their dependencies. The benchmark software package I developed for statistical model comparisons (outlined above) incorporates the raster and sp packages into its statistical calculations. I have also used R spatial packages to extract data points of remote-sensed and climate data for incorporation into the RS site database described above, and I used ArcGIS to extract vegetation and soil type information for these sites from vector datasets (the National Vegetation Information system and ASRIS Atlas of Australian Soils). I also used ArcGIS to construct maps of water-holding capacity, percolation rates and thermal diffusivity of soils based on ASRIS maps. I have since repeated this analysis using QGIS - an open source GIS software product.

I developed a new lightning-fire start model during my PhD <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> by comparing remote-sensed LIS lightning flash count data to point-based, ground lightning strike observations in order to determine if individual flashes were inter-cloud or cloud to ground. This involved determining location of strikes in satellite data and matching point-based ground observations using Matlab's HDF package. I have since repeated this analysis using raster and GIS packages in R.

In addition, during a coarse on Natural Hazards as part of my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I analysed movement and concentrations of volcanic ash clouds with multi-spectrum, split-window technique's using ENVI/IDL programming. I also used ENVI to detect and remove unwanted pixels (i.e, water and cloud), and to construct multi-band fire indices from MODIS burnt area products as part of my masters dissertation <citep> Kelley2008 </citep>.

<!--Publications in peer-reviewed international journals in a relevant field-->
<!--The ability to present research results and contribute to papers in high quality journals-->
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field (i.e Environmental Research Letters, Biogeosciences, New Phytologist). Please see my attached publication list.


<h3> Please provide details of your experience (if any) in computer programming, preferably within the ArcGIS and/or R environment.

The LPX model combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) with a UNIX-shell interface. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models in R, C, Python and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>.

I conduct most of my statistical analysis and plotting in R, but I also used Python, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages now available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools. See publication list for more details). One of my statistical packages (model benchmark metrics: <cite> Kelley2015 </cite>) has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).
