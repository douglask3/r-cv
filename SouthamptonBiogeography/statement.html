Dear Professor Lesley Gray

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Climate Modelling”, investigating the decadal influence of the solar cycle on stratospheric variability, and its impacts on the Earth’s weather and climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I utilised experimental and satellite data to develop and constrain a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestrial biosphere dynamics <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>. The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the essential skills outlined in the job specification, and my MSc in Earth Systems Science provides background knowledge of climate processes and climate dynamics. Below I have outlined the relevant skills I honed during my PhD, followed by my motivation for studying the influence of solar irradiance variations on climate.
