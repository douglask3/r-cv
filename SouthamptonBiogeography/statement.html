Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the position of “xxxx” as part of the SCALEFORES project.

Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod,

I have recently completed a PhD in Climate Change Ecology, where I utilised remote-sensed and ground-based observations, soil and land-cover GIS maps and constructed spatial databases of species richness and plant-traits to develop and constrain the LPX Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. I used LPX to explore potential future ecosystem resilience, carbon stocks, fire regimes, drought and hydrology in Australia. Models like LPX provide useful tools for understanding the broad-scale impact of climate on ecosystem dynamics. However, these models, like so many other mapping techniques designed to assess ecosystem services (ES), lack the detail and accuracy required for conservation decisions that, by necessity, often need to target specific ES "hotspots". This is partially due to a lack of primary observational data of ES required to constrain these techniques in many parts of the world. By determining scale-dependancy of relationships between different ESs in data-rich regions, SCALEFORS will help develop and test accurate ways to map hotspots in regions with limited observations. I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained during my PhD, outlined below, to help in the design of these methods that will help bridge an important gap between ecological modelling and conservation.

<h2> Ecosystem modelling and spatial data analysis</h2>
My work on developing and evaluating LPX and other vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, including raw and processed satellite data, vector ground and climate observations, and climate and vegetation model output. To do this, I have used a range of GIS and statistical software including ArcGIS, ENVI, R, Python and Matlab. More detail can be found in the "support statement" section of this application.

<h2> Collaborations </h2>
My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral work involved a number of research collaborations. For example, I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system which involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community.
<!--I was also involved in a consultancy programme performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted was used by RSCN to determine areas of relative ecosystem stability suitable for nature reserves. All of these collaborations involved visits to different institutions and workshops, some of which were international. I would be happy to continue this in my new role.-->

<h2> Communication </h2>
During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars. As a result, I won “best presentation” at the department's annual post-graduate conference and was awarded a travel grant to present simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting. I also acted as chair for my groups' research discussion meetings and was an informal mentor for several students who were new to statistical programming.

Whilst at Bristol, I volunteered as a note-taker at the 2008 Quest Annual Science Meeting. This involved summarising scientific information and recording decisions from workshops and working groups on a range of subjects from ocean ecosystem modelling, atmosphere dynamics and mitigation policy session.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that with my experience in vegetation modelling and spatial statistical analysis, I am well suited to the role. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley

I am preparing applications for the positions of “Research Fellow in Spatial Modelling” and "Research Fellow in Applied Biogeography" linked with the SCALEFORES project, and I have a few questions regarding the research the roles will be performing, and about the job itself. First off, may I offer my congragulations for obtaining the ERC state up grant for such an exciting and facinating project. Information on ecostsem function and service value will be vital for both mitigation stratagies <!--(i.e through <<>> such as carbon storage)-->
<!--and adpation policies to <<>> future enbviromental change. Your recent work on quantifying unicertainty in many of the techinaues used to map sevices shows how far we still have to go to identify specific 'hotspots' for protection, particualrly with <<>> of future land-use and climate change. This is why the SCALEFORES project is so timely and important.

My PhD in Climate Change Ecology explored future changes in ecosystem composition and prcoesses, and it's impact on future services such as carbon storage, fire enhancment or supression and hydrologyin Australia. I did this by constraining a DGVM (particularly the siomulation of fire - one of the most important vegetative controls in Auystralia) using remote sensed and ground observations of land-surface properties, and driving this model with present and future climate and land use. Data and model output analysis involved use of ARCGID, ENVI, R and R statistic packages (some of which I have written and published myself: <<link>>). A major theme of my MSc in Earth Systems Science was linking Earth System Processes to climate policy, mainly via ecosystem valuation - either via assigning monartary value, similar to Bib Costanvas work, or though other metrics like biodiversity or carbon storage. I found this the most fascinating askpect of the masters programme, and it played a major influance with the main aims of my PhD.

I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago (thesis available here: http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf) which used remote sensed, ground based observations and experimantal data to develope a vegetation model to simulate vegetation and terrestial processed in Australia. I used this model to assess and project ecosystem reliance and changes to future climate change, with a focus on exploring effects of future ecosysem proertises on services such as carbon storage and hydrology. As a dominant and (in terms of vegetation modleling context) under-study control of vegetation in Australia is fire, the model devlopment component of my thesis focuessed on improving simulation of fire and vegetation adpatation to fire. This involved site analysisng land cover, soil and climate controls on primary observations of plant and ecosystem traits, <<modelled surface>> <<proxy maps>>. I have therefore had extensive practice using ENVI and GIS softerware (inc. ArcGIS and its open source equivalents) in anyalysing remote sensed and land-surface GIS data. I have also used R and any of its GIS and statistical packages (and indeed have developed some R packages myself: <<link>>) for statitical analysis of ecosystem traits and modelled vegatation.
