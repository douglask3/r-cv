Dear Dr Felix Eigenbrod

I am preparing applications for the "Reasearch Fellow" positions linked with the SCALEFORES project. First off, may I offer my congragulations for obtaining the ERC state up grant for such an exciting and facinating project. Information on ecostsem function and service value will be vital for mitigation and adpatation to future enbviromental change. Your recent work on quantifying the uncertainty in many of the techniques and analytical decisions used to map sevices shows how far we still have to go to target specific 'hotspots' for protection, particualrly with added vulnerability associated with future enviromental change. This is why the SCALEFORES project is so timely and important. I have a few questions about the projects research aims, and a coiuple about appointment timings:

<li> Is "win-win" in the project descption equilvanet to areas of hotspot overlap (i.e Eigenbrod et al. 2010: Journal of Applied Ecology) </li>
<li> Will the project aim to find general rules of scale-dependancy applicable to any spaitally-distrubuted ecological service, or will the relationships between variables be targetted to specific services? Either way, which services will the project be testing/exploring?  </li>
<li> The "Research Fellow in Spatial Modellings" will ain to explore spatial-processes in the absence of components. What exactly are these components?
<li> I notice the "Research Fellow in Applied Biogeography" will be testing scale-dependancy of relationships in data-rich Europe. Will Europe therefore form the test ground for the project, before application to data-poor regions of the world? Are there any particular data-poor regions in mind?
<li> Obsioculy teh prject will be exploring scale-depenacy with present day obverstions. But are there any plans to apply any relationships found to future envirmental change? </li>

<li> I notice the positions starts from the 1st of July. Is this fixed or, if I was susscessful in my application, could the start date be bought forward? There wouldn't be any problem if not - and I see you are actually moving departments yourself so I'm guessing the timetable is pretty fixed. But it will just help me plan the next couple of months a bit. Do you know when are you planning to short-list/interview etc?


I hope thats not to many questions!

I look foreward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
