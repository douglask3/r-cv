Dear Dr. Jon Robson and panel,

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for position the “Research Scientist” as part of LOTUS and DYVA projects exploring variablity and changes in East Asian Climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I developed a complex numerical vegetation model to explore the impacts of future changes in mositure controls and tempurature in Australia.

Many of the climate controls and impacts are shared across Australia and China: both stradle wet, monsoonal and dry climates ranging tropical to temperate; both are prone to droughts and extreme tempuratures, often controlled by periodic ocean osciliations <citep> Ward2014</citep>; and both are exposed to highly uncertain but potentially devastating climate change, whereby changes in average and extremes in precipitation and tempurature may lead to more drought, dangerous heat-waves and changes in land productivity <citep>Scholze2006a; JimenezCisneros; Settele </citep>.


One way to reduce uncertainty in the impacts of climate change is to take advantage of teleconnections with preceding climate indicators such as ocean temperatures/temperature gradients (e.g. ENSO, AMO, Indian Ocean Indices, which exihbit ... controls in Asia; <cite>Todd2004; Mohino2011</cite>). However, these connections, and their impacts, are likely to change
with changes im climate forcing from anthto[pagenic emission CO2 and arosle <citep>Muller2006; Stevenson2012; Cai2014</citep>. ??Climate model teleconnections  uncetainty.

However, the impacts of climate change on water security in East Africa, and indeed most of the poorer regions of the world, are likely to be much worse than for Australia <citep>grey2007sink; Vorosmarty2010</citep>.  The rural poor, who make up roughly 80% of the regions population <citep>TheWorldBankGroup2016</citep>  are already severely affected by periodic droughts and floods <citep>Carter2007</citep>. The rapid economic development in some East African  countries <citep>Imf2012</citep> may, if unguided,  put additional strain on water resources, as has happened in other parts of the world where increased urbanisation has led to increased water demand from water-intensive agriculture and energy production and decreased supply because of pollution and changes in land use <citep>falkenmark1992population</citep>.

I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist the development of warning and mitigation strategies, as well as directly influencing policy decisions that will help the most populus part of the world adapt to climate change. I believe that CSSP China and its related projects is the ideal scheme for this – ??the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the complex nature of the impact of anthropagenic forcings on weather extremes, the programmes partnership with institutes in China will call on some of ??regions experts??, and will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

Below, I have outlined how my experience in climate research makes me an ideal candidate for the role, with reference to the job description and selection criteria. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.



<h2> Climate Science Research Portfolio </h2>
I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago. My thesis (“Modelling Australian Fire Regimes”, <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>), and subsequent postdoctoral research, focussed on climate dynamics in Australia, exploring the moisture controls on vegetation productivity and vegetation-fire interactions in tropical and subtropical wet and dry ecosystems – similar climate zones as those experienced in East Africa. It used satellite and ground-based observations of weather, climate and vegetation properties to develop and evaluate complex numerical vegetation models <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; Kelley; Hantson</citep>. I have driven some of these models with historical/reanalysis climate data to assess how teleconnections between ENSO and climate affect fire <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011</citep>. I used the model I developed as part of my thesis – the LPX-Mv1 vegetation model <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> - to assess the impact of future climate change on ecosystem resilience and the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire-dynamics <citep>Harrisonc</citep> and hydrology <citep>Ukkola</citep>. For these future climate experiments, I developed an “anomalies procedure” to derive inputs for LPX-Mv1 from CMIP5 future climate model data and to assess changes in climate variability from the present day <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>. My thesis demonstrated the importance of incorporating climate-vegetation-fire interactions into present and future climate impact assessments, with my improved dry-climate vegetation simulations altering the magnitude, and in some cases the sign, of predicted future vegetation resilience and water availability. This included counterintuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying parts of Australia <citep>Ukkola</citep>; and that the main driver for changes in fire, and therefore fire-related impacts, will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation cover rather than weather and climate <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>.

My thesis examiners consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed. I completed my PhD just over one year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.


<h2> Programming and data analysis skills </h2>
The LPX model, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets  in either NetCDF or CSV format. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models, as well as a simple climate box-model as part of my masters, in Python, R and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>, and have performed statistical analysis and plotting in Python, R, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (<cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new vegetation model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of GIS products,  from raw satellite data (e.g. the LIS/OTD flash counts in <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>; MODIS burnt area products in <cite>Kelley 2008</cite> & <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>) to processed satellite data (e.g. GFED  burnt area in <cite>Prentice2011; Kelley2013 </cite> & <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>; SeaWifs vegetation absorbed radiation in <cite>Kelley2013</cite>) and vector ground observation (lightning counts and fire observations in <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>). Processing these products has involved using a range of GIS software including ArcGIS and GRASS GIS (an open source equivalent), as well as GIS packages in R and Matlab.

Most of my work is conducted using Linux OS, but I have also worked with Windows and MacOS.


<h2> Projects, collaborations and communication </h2>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, and was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see CV for a full list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website  (www.eppingdac.com.au), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.


<h2> Mentoring and supervision </h2>
Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners. During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD.

In addition, I have been involved in two outreach programmes for students of various school ages. At Bristol, I was employed by the “Widening Participation office”, as an assistant for outreach workshops in primary schools, and helped with primary school open days at the University. During my PhD I volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.



Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that my climate research and numerical modelling experience, along with my publishing record and presentation skills, make me ideally suited to the role of Postdoctoral Researcher in African Climate Science.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
