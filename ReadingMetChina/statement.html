Dear Dr. Jon Robson and panel,

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for position the “Research Scientist” as part of LOTUS and DYVA projects exploring variablity and changes in East Asian Climate. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change, where I developed a complex numerical vegetation model to explore the impacts of future changes in mositure controls and tempurature in Australia.

Many of the climate controls and impacts are shared across Australia and China: both stradle wet, monsoonal and dry climates ranging tropical to temperate; both are prone to droughts and extreme tempuratures, often controlled by periodic ocean osciliations <citep> Ward2014</citep>; and both are exposed to highly uncertain but potentially devastating climate change, whereby changes in average and extremes in precipitation and tempurature may lead to more drought, dangerous heat-waves and changes in land productivity <citep>Scholze2006a; JimenezCisneros; Settele </citep>.

Uptill now, most of my research has focussed on the impacts of climate change, such as changes in fire <citep> Kelley2014; Harrison </citep>, drought <citep> Zeppel2015; Ukkola </citep> or floding <citep> Ukkola </citep>, with important consquances for regional adaptation decisions </citep> Harrison; Ukkola </citep> ?? However, these impact "forecasts" remain largley qualataive due to large uncertainties in predicted changes in climate variability and localised weather extremes (e.g. <cite> robson2010understanding; Harrison; refref </cite>). Reduction in near- to medium-term uncterainty (i.e annual to decadle), which would help effective dision making etc, can be achived via internal variablity (initailisation) and reduction in model error <citep> Hawkins2009a </citep>

Oceans variablity evolves slow (low frequiancy variablity)enough for e.g. seasonal forcasting <citep> Latif1998 </citep> to decadale ??refs pg 6 for AMO??; PDO

Predicability of inter0annual and dacadlabe SST from low frequancy events <citep> Boer2000; Boer2004; Boer2008 </citep>

Recently, tools have been devloepd to help with this. One such tool,  the UK Met Office’s Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys) hindcasts, has shown good at reproducing many ..., and attributing too ... <citep> Robson2012; Robson2012a </citep>.

<cite>Liu2012; Robson2013</cite>: Improvment in  DePreSys over land

<cite>Chang1999</cite>: Teleconnection between inter-decadale variaboility in East Asian Monsoon and Pacific SST

<cite>Lau2006</cite>: aroesol impact on East Asian Monsoon
One way to reduce uncertainty in the impacts of climate change is to take advantage of teleconnections with preceding climate indicators such as ocean temperatures/temperature gradients (e.g. ENSO, AMO, Indian Ocean Indices, which exihbit ... controls in Asia; <cite>Todd2004; Mohino2011</cite>). However, these connections, and their impacts, are likely to change
with changes im climate forcing from anthto[pagenic emission CO2 and arosle <citep>Muller2006; Stevenson2012; Cai2014</citep>. ??Climate model teleconnections  uncetainty.

East Asian Monsoon affects 1/3 worlds population

However, the impacts of climate change on water security in East Africa, and indeed most of the poorer regions of the world, are likely to be much worse than for Australia <citep>grey2007sink; Vorosmarty2010</citep>.  The rural poor, who make up roughly 80% of the regions population <citep>TheWorldBankGroup2016</citep>  are already severely affected by periodic droughts and floods <citep>Carter2007</citep>. The rapid economic development in some East African  countries <citep>Imf2012</citep> may, if unguided,  put additional strain on water resources, as has happened in other parts of the world where increased urbanisation has led to increased water demand from water-intensive agriculture and energy production and decreased supply because of pollution and changes in land use <citep>falkenmark1992population</citep>.

I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist the development of warning and mitigation strategies, as well as directly influencing policy decisions that will help the most populus part of the world adapt to climate change. I believe that CSSP China and its related projects is the ideal scheme for this – ??the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the complex nature of the impact of anthropagenic forcings on weather extremes, the programmes partnership with institutes in China will call on some of ??regions experts??, and will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

Below, I have outlined how my experience in climate research makes me an ideal candidate for the role, with reference to the job description and selection criteria. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.

<li> <citep> Kelley2014 </citep>: climate response detection

I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago. My thesis (“Modelling Australian Fire Regimes”, <cite>kelley2014modelling</cite>), and subsequent postdoctoral research, focussed on climate dynamics in Australia, exploring climate controls on vegetation productivity and vegetation-fire interactions. It used satellite and ground-based observations of weather, climate and vegetation properties to develop and evaluate complex numerical vegetation and land surfaace models <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; Kelley; Hantson</citep>. I have driven some of these models with historical/reanalysis climate data to assess how teleconnections between ENSO and climate affect fire <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011</citep>. I drove the model I developed as part of my thesis – the LPX-Mv1 vegetation model <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> - with 21st century CMIP5 climate model outputs to predict ecosystem resilience and the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire-dynamics <citep>Harrisonc</citep> and hydrology <citep>Ukkola</citep> in future climate. My thesis demonstrated the importance of incorporating climate-vegetation-fire interactions into present and future climate impact assessments, with my improved dry-climate vegetation simulations altering the magnitude, and in some cases the sign, of predicted future vegetation resilience and water availability. This included counterintuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying parts of Australia <citep>Ukkola</citep>; and that the main driver for changes in fire, and therefore fire-related impacts, will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation cover rather than weather and climate <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>.

My thesis examiners consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed. I completed my PhD just over one year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.

In dissatation for my MSc in Earth Systems Science, I incorporated a fire model into CCDAS -  a data assimilation system used to contrain phsyical based parameters for use in an Earth System Model framework -  using land-surface satellite opbservations <citep> Kelley2008; kaminski2013bethy </citep>. During my masters, I was also able to gain experiance working with the GENIE Earth System Model, and wrote a simple box-climate model.


<h2> Programming and data analysis skills </h2>
<li> Very good computing skills. </li>
<li> Programming in Fortran/IDL/Python/<b>Unix shell </b> </li>
<li> <b> Design, execution and analysis of climate model simulations </b> </li>
<li> Substantial experience in computer programming and data analysis </li>
<li> Experience of numerical or climate modelling </li>
<li> Analysis of climate model and observational data </li>

The LPX model, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models, as well as a simple climate box-model as part of my masters, in Python, R and Matlab <citep>Kelley2013; Kelley; Whitley</citep>, and have performed statistical analysis and plotting in Python, R, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (<cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016; Kelley2016</cite> – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS products, from raw satellite data (e.g. the LIS/OTD flash counts in <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>; MODIS burnt area products in <cite>Kelley 2008</cite> & <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>) to processed satellite data (e.g. GFED  burnt area in <cite>Prentice2011; Kelley2013 </cite> & <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>; SeaWifs vegetation absorbed radiation in <cite>Kelley2013</cite>); vector ground observation (lightning counts and fire observations in <cite>Kelley2014a</cite>); historical climate and climate reanalysis data <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014 </citep>; and climate model data for past <citep> Cias2011 </citep> and future climates <citep> Kelley2014; Harrison </citep>.

As well as remote sensed observation ouitlined above, work on the vegetetion benchmarking system incopororated ground-based and site-based obsveration.

<h2> Communication </h2>
<li> Good communication skills both written and oral </li>
<li> Self-motivated, <b>conscientious and creative </b> </li>

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see CV for a full list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting <citep>kelley2013implications</citep>.

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. <cite>Kelley2008a; Kelleya; Kelley2013a</cite>).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website  (www.eppingdac.com.au), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.

<h2>Projects and collaborations</h2>
<li> Communicative and open to collaboration </li>
<li> Willingness to under-take visits to relevant institutions/events </li>
<li> Ability to maintain productive working relationships with collaborators at Reading and other institutions </li>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>, whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, and was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

<h2> Department and Research Group involvment </h2>
<li> Enjoy working with others </li>
During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD. I also volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.

Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners.



Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that my climate research and numerical modelling experience, along with my publishing record and presentation skills, make me ideally suited to the Postdoctoral Researcher role.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
