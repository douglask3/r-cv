<!--Dear Professor ??? and Members of the Search Committee:-->
<!--I am writing to apply for the position of Lecturer in Climate and Environmental Science (Education and Research).-->

I am writing to enquire about the position of Lecturer in Climate and Environmental Science (Education and Research). I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology at the Macquarie University (Sydney) just over a year ago. My research expertise in Biosphere Dynamics ties together many of the lectureship’s key subject areas including Earth System Dynamics, Enviromental Biology, Ecosystem function and services and Climate Impacts. My research to date utlilises remote sensed, ground observations, field studies and experimental data to develope, parameterize and evaluate vegetation models, and using these models to run past and future climate impact experiments. These models range from simple (such as GDAY: ??url??), to complex dynamic models (e.g. LPX: Kelley et al. 2014) and land surface optimization systems (such as CCDAS: ??? et al. 2013). Working with such a diverse group of models means I have a broad knowldge of the different approuches used to model the terrestial biosphere. These models are also designed by different groups in a veriaty of programming languages, and my extensive experiance at large scale data anaylsis means I am also fluent in most stastical languages (Pyhton, R, matlab etc). I also have experiance in teaching Environtal Programming for begginners, focussing on project coding and documentation structure and tracking and sharing code with other enniromnental scientists.

I was wondering if you would be interesting in an application from an Ecological and Envirmontal modelling expert? As I am a recent graduate, I would obviously be applying the the Lecturer level (as opposed to senior Lecturer etc). Would you also consider applicants at my career stage? My cv (attached) gives a little more information including publication record and award.

Douglas Kelley.






<!-- My many years of experieance at large scale data analysis and vegetation modelling ?? programmiung skills etc??/.-->





My five years of teaching experience at the graduate and undergraduate levels and record in taking part in academic life make me a highly qualified candidate for the position.


As my research utilises extensive remote sensed, ground observations, field studies and experimantal data to develope and paramterise vegetation and land surface models, I have ?? skill at ??data collection?? and analysis. Combined with my modelling skills


Firstly, I have a strong research record in transitional justice and International Relations. My PhD
thesis focuses on the contribution of Truth Commissions to post-conflict reconciliation. Drawing on
eight months of field research, I argued that Truth Commissions in Sierra Leone and Peru had an
impact on how individuals and groups made claims for justice and restitution. In contrast to earlier
Truth Commissions, my thesis examined cases where Truth Commissions were established
alongside prosecutions. I argued that existing theory and practice has inadequately acknowledged
the challenges of pursuing a judicial and restorative approach in tandem.
I am committed to publishing high quality research. I am currently working on converting my PhD
thesis into a book manuscript and turning chapters into articles for publication. I am preparing an
article on the Sierra Leonean transitional justice process for submission to a special forum for the
Journal of Modern African Studies. My future research agenda entails reviewing and processing the
extensive primary data I gathered in 2011 in Peru and publishing more in depth analyses from this
material. I would like to more systematically examine questions, raised by my PhD, particularly how
Truth Commissions can function alongside war crimes prosecutions since the establishment of the
International Criminal Court. I am also working on a co-edited volume for Cambridge University
Press, evaluating the impact of transitional justice in Sierra Leone.

Secondly, my undergraduate and graduate teaching portfolio and training make me well prepared to
teach “Law and Conflict in International Society” and “The Art of War Studies”. My undergraduate
and graduate teaching at the LSE, Brandeis University, and the University of Oxford examined
global policy and normative debates on issues related to international justice and conflict and peace
studies. I have an interdisciplinary teaching background, having taught courses in political
philosophy, International Relations, constitutional law and conflict and peace-studies. I would be
prepared to teach modules on “Peace and Justice”, “Prosecuting War Crimes”, “Moving Images and
Modern War”, and “Commemorating War”. My summer teaching at the American University in
Kosovo and work on the Balkans for the Aspen Institute Germany give me a foundation to teach
courses on the Yugoslav War.

In line with the Department of War Studies’ emphasis on traditional and innovative learning, I have
developed a dynamic and wide-ranging teaching skill set. In my teaching, I use inductive student
centred materials and task-based exercises, such as simulations and debates, formative
assessments and small group assignments. I emphasize applied learning, linking theoretical
analysis with in depth case studies, and inviting guest speakers and organizing outings. I am skilled
in using electronic resources, having managed electronic learning sites at the LSE and the
University of Oxford. My supervision and examination of Masters dissertations at the University of
Oxford give me a strong foundation to supervise research students. I have experience in developing
course curricula and teaching methods, having devised my own syllabus for the peace-building
programme at the American University in Kosovo. I am currently completing a postgraduate
certificate in education at the LSE and consistently received excellent evaluations from students and
course conveners.

Thirdly, I am prepared to contribute actively to academic service and departmental life at University
College London and to further the work of the War Crimes Research Group. Throughout my PhD, I
regularly presented at seminars and attended and organized conferences and events. I successfully
generated funding for my own research and academic functions. I recently co-organized and
secured funding for a high profile conference on transitional justice in Sierra Leone. The conference
brought together international practitioners, such as the Prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra
Leone, Maria Spence, and academics from the UK and Sierra Leone, and was well attended by
academics, practitioners and the Sierra Leonean community in London. I have strong teamwork and
leadership abilities. My experience as chief editor of Millennium: Journal of International Studies
required intensive collaboration with co-editors and close supervision of staff and interns. In my
capacity as editor and teacher, I served as a mentor and referee for a large number of students. My
work as editor during my PhD demonstrated my ability to balance multiple tasks and responsibilities.

Lastly, my specialized work on memory and conflict is a particular factor that I would bring to the
position. The study of memory would provide a unique lens to look at the intersection of law and
conflict. Collective memory plays a prominent role in my PhD thesis, both as a driver of conflict,
shaping group identities, as well as a conduit through which groups find common ground after
violence. I pursued my interest in memory through a special forum I designed on memory and
violence for Millennium: Journal of International Studies and by incorporating memory studies into

my teaching curricula.
The University College London War Studies lectureship presents an ideal opportunity to pursue my
career goals as a researcher and teacher. I am passionate about teaching and would embrace the
chance to teach in a collegial and highly regarded department and to contribute to the development
of the War Studies programme. I am attracted to the Department’s interdisciplinary orientation and
the lectureship’s unique focus on the nexus of law and war studies. I am strongly committed to
mentoring students and contributing to innovative research in transitional justice.

Please contact me if you require any additional information.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my application.

Sincerely,

Douglas Kelley
