
<h2> Academic Attainment </h2>
<h3>Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, at level 2.2 or above, in a physical science, mathematics or computing subject or equivalent experience </h3>
I have recently completed a PhD in climate change where I developed and constrained a complex numerical model of land-surface processes <citep>Kelley2014a</citep> to help improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between climate and terrestrial biosphere dynamics <citep>kelley2014modelling</citep>.  The research experience I gained during my PhD covers the skills outlined in the job specification. My MSc in Earth System Science provides a broader overview of the Earth and climate system, with an emphasis on climate modelling and feedbacks. During my MSc, I was given the opportunity to write my own simple climate-box model and gained experience driving a GCM (MITgcm) and the ocean component of an Earth System Model (GENIE). The module on natural hazards also included the impact of future changes in climate variability on the incidence of fire and storms.

For my PhD in climate change I utilised satellite, ground-based and experimental observation to develop and constrain  models of terrestrial biosphere processes <citep>Kelley2013; kaminski2013bethy; Kelley2014a; Kelley</citep>. I have driven some of these models with present climate data and future climate outputs from CMIP5 models to explore the impacts of future climate change on biosphere dynamics, including ecosystem resilience, the carbon cycle <citep>Kelley2014b</citep>, fire/drought disturbances and resultant carbon emissions <citep>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Zeppel2014; Harrisonc</citep>, and hydrology </citep>Ukkola</citep>. My thesis (available here: <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf" target = "_blank"> douglask3.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf</a>) was well received by my examiners, who consistently stated that it fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed.

<b> Innovative research </b>
For my PhD, I developed an explicit iterative approach to model development in the Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX: <cite>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a</cite>) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), in which benchmarking against observations is used to identify areas for new data-driven parameterizations and then subsequently used to evaluate whether the implementation of these new parameterizations produces an overall improvement in model performance. This approach contrasts with the general tendency within the vegetation modelling community to focus evaluation on new components, for example, the evaluation of fire treatments within DGVMs using only observations of burnt area and/or fire carbon fluxes (see e.g. <cite>Li2012; Pfeiffer2013 </cite>). One reason for this partial approach to evaluation was the lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system <cite>Luo2012</cite>). I therefore developed a comprehensive benchmarking system which allows quantitative evaluation of multiple aspects of simulated processes to identify specific model weaknesses and differences between model versions, allowing assessment of the overall impact of new parameterizations. This allowed me to target model development in my thesis . This system is now starting to be adopted by other modelling groups and is being used by a new Model Intercomparison Project to assess the impact of different fire modelling approaches <citep>Hantson</citep>, and to help guide the developmental direction of the fire-vegetation modelling community <citep>Hantson2016</citep>.

<b> Workflow </b>
The fundamentals of any computer programming project is the automation of tasks (imagine trying to solve the state and differential equations in any climate or Earth system model billions of times by hand!). However, this is a principle often forgotten in the vegetation modelling community. This was the case when I inherited the LPX-DGVM. Each new experiment had to be set-up individually - changing initial state conditions, input file names and paths by hand - and then having to manipulate outputs for analysis after the model had completed each run. Applications of LPX always involve multiple runs (e.g, spin-ups and transient runs for multiple climate model inputs in <cite>Ciais2011; Harrisonc<cite>, multiple models, scenarios and CO2 concentrations in <cite>Kelley2014b; Harrison2010</cite>, or different LPX-setups in <cite> Kelley2014a </cite>). I solved this problem by introducing an R and Unix shell-based interface which allows 'switching' between different inputs and/or model configurations, and processing and basic analysis of model outputs based on a small number of interface inputs. This not only saves a huge amount of time, but drastically decreases the possibility of typos and mistakes occuring in runs, and has helped make the model much easier for others to set up and use.

I now try to apply this principle of automation to all of my work. Any code I have developed that I am likely to use again I convert into easily imported libraries or software packages, which can also be easily shared with other people. For examples, <citet>Kelley2015</citet> has been picked up by a model intercomparison project (fireMIP, <cite>Hantson2016</cite>).

<h3>Evidence of capability to work in a highly collaborative environment both internally and externally, with good inter-personal skills </h3>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  <citep>Kelley2013</citep> which  involved liaising with remote sensing experts, statisticians, botanists and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on <citep>Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; harrisonusing; Harrison</citep>.

During my PhD, my excellent inter-personal skills enabled me to act as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming. and volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days - both of which show how well I work with others, for the benefit of the group as a whole.

In addition, I was also involved in an external international consultancy programme, performing climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society with the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long-term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, which was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves <citep>harrison2010impacts</citep>.

<hr>


<h3>Good scientific computing skills, ideally with experience of automation through scripting languages (such as Perl and python) and of numerical analysis </h3>
The LPX model <citep> Prentice2011; Kelley2014a </citep>, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets in either NetCDF or CSV format. Handling the data used to constrain and drive this model has provided a wealth of experience with shell scripting for data file organisation, and statistical and GIS programming for analysis (e.g Python, R, Matlab, IDL, ArcGIS and its open source equivalents). I have published some of my statistical code independently as software packages available for anyone to download and use (e.g. <cite>Kelley2015; Whitley2016</cite> – both available from <a href ="http://douglask3.github.io/tools" target ="_blank">http://douglask3.github.io/tools</a>), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: <cite>Hantson2016; Hantson</cite>).

<h3>Experience of working with scientific simulation or analysis codes, using parallel computing techniques (e.g. MPI, OpenMP) in HPC environments </h3>
Whilst working on the LPX model, I developed a Unix-shell to aid parallel processing when performing runs with multiple climate realisations (such as at 36 CMIP5 future runs conducted in <cite>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</cite>). I coded a fire-risk model <citep>Harrisonc</citep> which can be run on multiple cores in R, and I have experience working with a simple vegetation model that can parallelized on a grid-cell level in C (<a href = "https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY"> https://github.com/douglask3/cGDAY </a>).

<h3>Experience of the execution and analysis of data from climate or weather models on HPC platforms</h3>
As well as my experience driving vegetation and fire models using parallel computing, I have attended training courses on code structure and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems on an HPC platform. I have applied the programming principles these courses introduced into my code development of projects (e.g. see http://douglask3.github.io/firemip for my latest project)

<h3>Experience of working with and managing large data sets </h3>
My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of climate/GIS data products, such as raw and processed satellite data (see e.g. <cite>Kelley2008; Prentice2011; Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; Kelley2014b</cite>); vector ground observation (<cite>Kelley2013; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling; Harrison</cite>); historical climate and climate reanalysis data <citep>Prentice2011; Kelley2014a; kelley2014modelling</citep>; and climate model data for past <citep>Ciais2011</citep> and future climates <citep>Kelley2014b; Harrisonc</citep>. Recent work on simulating future land-surface processes  provided the best example of managing large and complex datasets. Here, I initially drove the LPX-DGVM  with detrended historic climate data, pre-industrial land use and atmospheric compositions in order to spin-up the model. I then used historic climate, land use and atmospheric composition to drive the model up to the modern day. This then transitioned into 36 different climate realisations, based on 9 CMIP5 models from two different RCPs, and four atmospheric CO2 pathways. Each step involved processing and organising several GBs worth of data, and historic simulations involved model evaluation against remote sensed and ground-based observations in order to justify model use. This one project was all initially published in <citet>Kelley2014b</citet>, but has since spawned other papers (e.g. <cite>Harrisonc; Ukkola</cite>).

<h2> Communication Skillls </h2>

<h3> Evidence of helping to develop the technical knowledge and skills of others </H3>

<hr>

<h3> Evidence of good written and oral communication skills </h3>
I completed my PhD just over one year ago,  and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications – 3 of which I first authored - with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all the others are in high-impact journals for their field. I have also presented my research at a variety of conferences, visits, and internal departmental presentations. I was awarded “best presentation” at my department's annual postgraduate conference and won a travel grant to present simulations of future climate impacts at the AGU fall meeting <citep> kelley2013implications </citep>.


<h2> Climate Science Knowledge Research Experience </h2>

<h3> Experience in understanding a relevant scientific area necessary to allow the applicant to communicate effectively with other scientists and to understand scientific requirements of technical work. </h3>



<h3> Understanding of climate projections and climate change </h3>
Many of the predicted impacts of my research have important consequences for mitigation <citep>Kelley2014b</citep> and adaptation <citep>Ukkola; Harrisonc</citep> policies. However, these impact "forecasts" still remain largely qualitative due to uncertainties in future climate variability and their impact on localised weather extremes (e.g. <cite>Friedlingstein2006; robson2010understanding; Harrisonc</cite>). I have taken into account uncertainty in climate "scenarios" in these studies by using multiple RCPs and providing impact projections tied to specific changes in radiative forcing. Process uncertainty is quantified through the inclusion of multiple models, providing a "range" of realisations for each RCP and the ability to test if changes in impacts are robust and/or significant <citep> Kelley2014a; Harrisonc </citep>. However, there are two other types of uncertainty important for future forecasts of disturbance that require further research. The first, uncertainty in natural variations, is important only for near-term projections (e.g. <cite>hawkins2009potential</cite>). The second, uncertainty in weather extremes <citep>randall2007climate</citep>, is an issue for longer term future climate projections.

One reason why extreme weather is poorly resolved in climate models is because it is largely caused by sub-grid level processes compared to the resolution that climate models are traditional run at (i.e extreme lighting and rain from convective storms). However, recent advances in scientific understanding of unified weather and climate prediction, and computing power provide the opportunity to explore much finer scale regional future climate simulations which could provide invaluable information to aid adaptation strategies. I would relish the opportunity to apply the experience I gained from modelling climate change impacts to the challenge of improving our predictive understanding of changes in extreme weather - vital for climate change adaptations.


<!--
An open research question remains, however, regarding the ability of the current generation of climate models to provide societies with accurate and reliable predictions of regional climate change, including the statistics of extreme events and high impact weather, which are required for global and local adaptation strategies. http://heron.directrouter.co.uk/~itfnvazy/hrcm/

The Weather and Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Modelling Panel (WMP) recently concluded that “regional projections from the current generation of climate models were sufficiently uncertain to compromise the goal of providing society with reliable predictions of regional climate change. Therefore, a major recommendation by the group was that, to meet the expectations of society, it is both necessary and possible to revolutionise climate prediction.
