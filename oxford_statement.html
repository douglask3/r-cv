Dear Professor Richard Washington,

My name is Douglas Kelley, and I would like to be considered for the role of “Postdoctoral Researcher in African Climate Science” as part of the REACH programme. I have recently completed a PhD in climate change ecology, where I developed a complex numerical vegetation model to explore the impacts of future climate change in a moisture controlled tropical region similar to East Africa: Australia.

Many of the climate controls and impacts are shared across Australia and East Africa: both have transitions from wet to dry tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems, where natural and agricultural productivity is particularly sensitive to available moisture (Seddon et al. 2016); both are prone to water-related natural disasters such as drought, flooding and fire (Lehmann et al. 2011; Ward et al. 2014); and both are exposed to highly uncertain but potentially devastating climate change, whereby changes in precipitation, increases in evaporation, and increases in extreme precipitation events may lead to more flooding and drought (Scholze et al. 2006; Jiménez Cisneros et al. 2014; Settele et al. 2014).

However, the impacts of climate change on water security in East Africa, and indeed most of the poorer regions of the world, are likely to be much worse than for Australia (Grey & Sadoff, 2007; Vorosmarty et al. 2010).  The rural poor, who make up roughly 80% of the regions population (The Would Bank Group, 2016)  are already severely affected by periodic droughts and floods (Carter et al. 2007). The rapid economic development in some East African  countries (IMF, 2012) may, if unguided,  put additional strain on water resources, as has happened in other parts of the world where increased urbanisation and has led to increased water demand from water-intensive agriculture and energy productionm and decreased supply because of pollution and changes in land use (Falkenmark & Widstrand 1992).

One way to mitigate possible harmful effects of climate change on water security is continued  development and implementation of “early warning systems” which allow countries to predict and prepare for future drought events or flood-prone seasons (Washington & Downing, 1999; Washington et al. 2006). These systems often take advantage of teleconnections with preceding climate indicators such as ocean temperatures/temperature gradients (e.g. ENSO, AMO, Indian Ocean Indices, shown to be particularly useful in East and Southern Africa; Todd & Washington, 2004; Mohino et al. 2011). However, these connections, and their resultant impacts, are likely to change with climate (Müller & Roeckner 2006; Stevenson 2011; Cai et al. 2014) and land cover (Sitch et al. 2008; Harrison & Kelley submitted). This is perhaps of particular concern in East Africa where, for example, the transition from drought-prone north to flood-prone equatorial regions during EL Nino years has already proven difficult to predict for even the current El Nino event (Bonifacio, 2015).

I would relish the opportunity to use the skills and experience I gained from my time in Australia to contribute to a research team that can assist the development of warning and mitigation strategies, as well as directly influencing policy decisions that will help some of the world most vulnerable people adapt to climate change. I belive that the REACH research programme at Oxford is the ideal environment for this – the cross-disciplinary set-up will draw on the full range of expertise needed to tease apart the complex nature of the impact of climate variability on water security, whilst the groups' social science component, and the programmes partnership with universities and institutes in Africa, will help ensure research is directly applicable and relevant to the people the programme is designed to help. In short, the potential value of your research in terms of future environmental and political/social impacts cannot be overstated and it is for this reason that I would very much like to be a part of your team.

Below, I have outlined how my experience in climate research makes me an ideal candidate for the role, with reference to the job description and selection criteria. Further details are also provided in my attached CV.



<h2> Climate Science Research Portfolio </h2>
I completed my PhD in Climate Change Ecology just over a year ago. My thesis (“Modelling Australian Fire Regimes”, Kelley 2014), and subsequent postdoctoral research, focussed on climate dynamics in Australia, exploring the moisture controls on vegetation productivity and vegetation-fire interactions in tropical and subtropical wet and dry ecosystems – similar climate zones as those experienced in East Africa. It used satellite and ground-based observations of weather, climate and vegetation properties to develop and evaluate complex numerical vegetation models (Prentice et al. 2011; Kelley et al. 2014; Kelley et al. in prep; Stijn et al in prep). I have driven some of these models with historical/reanalysis climate data to assess how teleconnections between ENSO and climate affect fire (Kelley, 2008; Prentice et al. 2011). I used the model I developed as part of my thesis – the LPX-Mv1 vegetation model (Kelley et al. 2014) - to assess the impact of future climate change on ecosystem resilience and the carbon cycle (Kelley & Harrison 2014) fire-dynamics (Harrison & Kelley, submitted) and hydrology (Ukkola et al. submitted). For these future climate experiments, I developed an “anomalies procedure” to derive inputs for LPX-Mv1 from CMIP5 future climate model data (Kelley & Harrison 2014) and to assess changes in climate variability from present day climate. My thesis demonstrated the importance of incorporating climate-vegetation-fire interactions into present and future climate impact assessments, with my improved dry-climate vegetation simulations altering the magnitude, and in some cases the sign, of predicted future vegetation resilience and water availability. This included counterintuitive but important results that policymakers need to take into account, such as: CO2-related increases in vegetation may have added pressure on available water supply in already dry and drying parts of Australia (Ukkola et al. 2014); and that the main driver for changes in fire, and therefore fire-related impacts, will be almost entirely controlled by changes in vegetation cover rather than weather and climate (Kelley & Harrison 2014; Harrison & Kelley submitted).

My thesis examiners consistently stated my thesis fell into the “top 10%” they've ever assessed. I completed my PhD just over one year ago, and I have obtained 7 peer-reviewed publications  – 3 of which are first authored – with a further 3 submitted and 3 near submission. One of these papers is in Nature Geoscience, and all others are in high-impact journals for their field.

<h2> Programming and data analysis skills </h2>
The LPX model, that I have been the lead developer on for 6 years, combines FORTRAN (for the scientific component) and C++ (for the I/O component) and can be driven by large-scale climate datasets  in either NetCDF or CSV format. I have also used and developed simple vegetation models, as well as a simple climate box-model as part of my masters, in Python, R and Matlab (Kelley et al. 2013; Kelley et al. in prep; Whitley et al. in prep), and have performed statistical analysis and plotting in Python, R, Matlab and, during my masters, in IDL. I have developed some of my R-code into software packages, now available for anyone to download and use (Kelley 2015; Kelley & Whitley 2016 – both available from http://douglask3.github.io/tools), one of which has recently been adopted and applied to a new vegetation model inter-comparison project (fireMIP: Stijn et al. submitted & in prep).

My work on developing and evaluating vegetation models has involved processing a range of GIS products,  from raw satellite data (e.g. the LIS/OTD flash counts in Kelley et al. 2014; MODIS burnt area products in Kelley 2008 & Kelley et al. 2014) to processed satellite data (e.g. GFED  burnt area in Prentice et al. 2011; Kelley et al. 2013 & 2014; SeaWifs vegetation absorbed radiation in Kelley et al. 2013) and vector ground observation (lightning counts and fire observations in Kelley et al. 2014). Processing these products has involved using a range of GIS software including ArcGIS and GRASS GIS (an open source equivalent), as well as GIS packages in R and Matlab.

Most of my work is conducted using Linux OS, but I have also worked with Windows and MacOS.


<h2> Projects, collaborations and communication </h2>
I have been involved in several inter-university and interdisciplinary collaborations during my PhD. I led the design of a vegetation model benchmarking system  (Kelley et al. 2013) which  involved remote liaising with sensing experts, botanists, statisticians and other modellers from three different institutions. This system has been widely adopted throughout the vegetation modelling community and is used by several other modelling groups. I have also worked on three vegetation disturbance-trait databases, two of which I was a lead collaborator on (Kelley et al. 2014; Kelley 2014; Harrison et al. 2014; Harrison et al. in prep), whose design team included experimentalists, plant ecologists and social scientists.

Outside of my academic work, I was also involved in an international consultancy programme, preforming climate change risk analysis for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in Jordan. Modelling work I conducted for this project focussed on the impacts of predicted short and long term changes in precipitation and rising temperature on ecosystem resilience and river flow, and was used by RSCN to determine areas of key ecological importance and relative stability suitable for nature reserves (Harrison 2010).

During my PhD, I was given the opportunity to hone my presentation skills at many group and department seminars (see CV for a full list of presentations). As a result, I was awarded “best presentation” at the departments annual post-graduate conference, out of 78 other presenting students, and was awarded a travel grant to present results of simulations of future ecosystem resilience and carbon stocks at the AGU fall meeting (Kelley et al. 2013b).

I have also attended several workshops, where I have given oral and poster presentations to audiences from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. Kelley & Harrison 2008; Kelley et al. 2011; Kelley et al. 2013c).

In my own time, I designed my running clubs website  (www.eppingdac.com.au), published the clubs newsletter for two years, and was in charge of the clubs publicity for three, during which club membership increased by nearly 50%.


<h2> Mentoring and supervision </h2>
Whilst working as a research assistant at Bristol, I was involved in the teaching of the MSc Earth Systems Science masters programme, giving seminars on causes of, and controls on, wildfire, as well as running modelling workshops on programming for beginners. During my PhD I acted as chair for my research groups' paper and research discussion meetings. I was also an informal mentor for several students in the group who were new to statistical programming, including a student who started their PhD as the result of a knowledge exchange initiative from the conclusion of the consultancy work conducted with the RSCN in Jordon, outlined above. This student has recently completed and passed their PhD.

In addition, I have been involved in two outreach programmes for students of various school ages. At Bristol, I was employed by the “Widening Participation office”, as an assistant for outreach workshops in primary schools, and helped with primary school open days at the University. During my PhD I volunteered with the department's secondary school outreach programme, performing research demonstrations on school open days.



Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I hope you agree that my climate research and numerical modelling experience, along with my publishing record and presentation skills, make me ideally suited to the role of Postdoctoral Researcher in African Climate Science.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on the phone number and email address listed above. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Douglas Kelley
